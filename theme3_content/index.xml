&lt;p>Say you are looking for a new job. You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476">new study&lt;/a> of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don't know well enough to share a personal connection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strength-of-weak-ties">The strength of weak ties&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1973, the American sociologist &lt;a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mark-granovetter">Mark Granovetter&lt;/a> coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086%2F225469">the strength of weak ties&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weak-ties-and-jobs">Weak ties and jobs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Granovetter's theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform's &amp;ldquo;People You May Know&amp;rdquo; recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this &amp;ldquo;A/B testing&amp;rdquo; to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many &amp;ldquo;job transmissions&amp;rdquo; occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moderately-weak-ties-are-best">Moderately weak ties are best&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What's a &amp;ldquo;moderately&amp;rdquo; weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-recommendations">Better recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter's theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-black-boxes">The power of black boxes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28051930">Facebook's infamous emotion experiment of 2014&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, could LinkedIn's experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the &amp;ldquo;strong link&amp;rdquo; treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Job Transitions in a Time of Automation and Labour Market Crises</title><link>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme3_content/job_transitions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme3_content/job_transitions/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We build a machine learning-based &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> that can accurately predict the probability of transitioning between occupations. We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles and real-time job ads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also build a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our latest research, &lt;a href="authors/nik-dawson/">Nik Dawson&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="authors/ma-rizoiu/">Marian-Andrei Rizoiu&lt;/a> (together with collaborator &lt;a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-mary-anne-williams">Mary-Anne Williams&lt;/a>) and I developed a novel method to measure the &amp;lsquo;distance&amp;rsquo; between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em> using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn't to say that it's not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-skill-space-method">The SKILL SPACE Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between skills&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage&amp;rsquo; (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1A.png" alt="Figure 1A.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python&amp;rsquo; and ‘C++&amp;rsquo;. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development&amp;rsquo; and ‘Healthcare&amp;rsquo;) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge&amp;rsquo; to specialist skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em>. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1B.png" alt="Figure 1B.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244">Frey and Osborne&lt;/a> - dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo;, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo; represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="constructing-a-job-transitions-recommender-system">Constructing a Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that &lt;strong>job transitions are &lt;em>asymmetric&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual&amp;rsquo; (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset - described as the transition probability between a ‘source&amp;rsquo; and a ‘target&amp;rsquo; occupation. This creates the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em>, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig2.png" alt="Figure 2.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source&amp;rsquo; occupations are in columns and ‘targets&amp;rsquo; are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager&amp;rsquo; has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk&amp;rsquo; than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas&amp;rsquo;) than others (‘Life Scientists&amp;rsquo;). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our model achieves high levels of performance, &lt;strong>accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommending-jobs-and-skills">Recommending Jobs and Skills&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations. We call this the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em>. In the figure below, we highlight the example of `Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo;, an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig4.png" alt="Figure 4.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we use the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo; all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential&amp;rsquo; services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo;, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favorable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo; as the target occupation for this example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Skill recommendations for target occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then take the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is important to the target occupation&lt;/strong> &lt;em>and&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance to acquire the skill is large&lt;/strong> (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance&amp;rsquo;. Conversely, the reasons &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to develop a skill are when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is not important&lt;/strong> &lt;em>or&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance is small to the target occupation&lt;/strong>. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs require ‘Business Analysis&amp;rsquo; and ‘Finance&amp;rsquo; skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing&amp;rsquo; and ‘Laundry&amp;rsquo; are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developing-a-leading-indicator-of-ai-adoption">Developing a Leading Indicator of AI Adoption&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE method can also be flexibly applied to other adjacent problems, such as identifying the extent of specific skill gaps of firms within industries and potential adoption of new technologies. Here, we develop a leading indicator for emerging technology adoption and potential labour market disruptions based on skills data, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example. We select AI because of its potential impacts on transforming labour tasks and accelerating job transitions. By applying SKILL SPACE, we were able to measure the yearly similarities between an adaptive set of AI skills against each of the 19 Australian industries from 2013-2019 (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for technical details). As industry skill sets become more similar to AI skills, the skills gap is diminished and firms within industries are more likely to possess the skills to make productive use of AI technologies. The growth of AI skill similarity within industries is shown by the coloured areas of the radar chart below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig5.png" alt="Figure 5.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All industries have increased their similarity levels to AI skills. This highlights the growing importance of AI skills across the Australian labour market. However, the rates of similarity are unequally distributed. Some industries, such as ‘Finance and Insurance Services&amp;rsquo; and ‘Information Media and Telecommunications&amp;rsquo; command much higher rates of AI skill similarity. This indicates that not only are firms within these industries increasingly demanding AI skills but also that the AI skills gaps within these industries are much smaller. Therefore, it is likely that firms within these industries are adopting AI and making productive use of these technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also noteworthy are the differences in growth rates toward AI skill similarity. As the figure above clearly shows, AI skill similarity has rapidly grown for some industries and more modestly for others. For instance, ‘Retail Trade&amp;rsquo; has experienced the highest levels of growth in similarity to AI skills, increasing by 407% from 2013 to 2019. The majority of this growth has occurred recently, which coincides with the launch of Amazon Australia in 2017. Since then, Amazon has swiftly hired thousands in Australia. This indicator can assist policy-makers and businesses to robustly monitor the growth of AI skills (or other emerging technologies), which acts as a proxy for AI adoption within industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises, and other factors will continue to shift labour demands causing workers to move between jobs. If labour transitions occur efficiently, significant productivity and equity benefits arise at all levels of the labour market; if transitions are slow, or fail, significant costs are borne to both the State and the individual. Therefore, it's in the interests of workers, firms, and governments that labour transitions are efficient and effective. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.&lt;/p>
