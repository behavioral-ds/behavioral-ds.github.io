&lt;p>In our digital age, the surge of online extremism brings forth urgent concerns such as hate speech normalization, user radicalization, and societal division. Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="interventions-in-the-online-opinion-ecosystem">Interventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-the-opinion-market-model">Our Solution: The Opinion Market Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions&amp;rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users&amp;rsquo; attention in the online realm.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="./featured.png" width="60%">
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \(S(t)\) (gray) and interventions \(X(t)\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity.
The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="datasets">Datasets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/strong> The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mainstream media cannot be trusted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires and climate change are not related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, &amp;hellip; , 5}}\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exogenous signal \(S(t)\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query &amp;ldquo;bushfire+climate change&amp;rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \({X_k(t)}\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset.&lt;/strong> We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \(S_i(t)\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \({X_k(t)}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="predicting-opinion-volumes-and-market-shares">Predicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="uncovering-latent-opinion-interactions">Uncovering Latent Opinion Interactions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions.&lt;/strong> Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-) and &amp;ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires&amp;rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion &amp;ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia&amp;rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO Artists.&lt;/strong> We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="omm-as-a-testbed-for-interventions">OMM as a Testbed for Interventions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can leverage the OMM in a &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\) separately. For Facebook, reputable news generally suppresses far-right opinions and most controversial news reinforces them, except for certain topics like &amp;ldquo;Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires&amp;rdquo; (\(R_0\)) and &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by arsonists.&amp;rdquo; (\(R_4\)) On Twitter, both reputable and controversial news suppress far-right opinions, except for reputable news related to certain topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The insights are twofold: firstly, Facebook's effect is moderate compared to Twitter due to Facebook's filter bubble nature. Secondly, indiscriminately increasing reputable news on Twitter can be ineffective and even counterproductive as it might attract more attention to far-right narratives and users (see \(R_3\) and \(R_4\)) [22].&lt;/p>

&lt;h2>Ideology in an Online World&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideology determines how we make sense of much of the world, our opinions, and our political actions.
It is not a new concept; throughout history, it served as the context for unrest.
However, ideological spread and radicalization have entered a new paradigm in our ever-connected world. The internet is a significant source of information and spreads opinions quickly through social platforms.
In particular, the anonymity and lack of accountability often associated with online communication set up a supportive environment for spreading far-right ideologies and radicalizing individuals into extremist groups.
Far-right extremism is a form of ideology that advocates for ultranationalism, racism, and opposition to immigration and multiculturalism.
These ideologies strongly correlate with violence and terrorism and threaten individual and collective security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raised concerns about Australians being radicalized very young and the rise of extremist movements in Australia through online technologies &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-asio" role="doc-biblioref">&lt;span>“Director-General’s Annual Threat Assessment”&lt;/span> 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.
ASIO claimed that during the COVID period, 30-40% of their caseload was devoted to far-right extremism, up from 10-15% in 2016 &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-guardian1" role="doc-biblioref">Karp 2020&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE) continues to be an issue in Australia.
On December 12th, 2022, two Queensland police officers were killed while performing routine duties &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-guardian2" role="doc-biblioref">Gillespie and McGowan 2022&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.
Later investigations would uncover that the three people, who killed the officers, were active online in producing deep-state and religious conspiratorial content.
Their content has since been removed from mainstream social platforms but continues to be shared on conspiratorial websites.
Such extreme-leaning content often serves as a lead indicator of violent extremism (as was the case in this incident and the Christchurch Mosque Shootings three years prior). However, the tools to identify and understand the psychosocial characteristics of these extreme individuals and communities are lacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this work, we build an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline and psychosocial profiles of ideological groups.
We find that right-leaning individuals tend to use moral-vice language more than left-leaning and that far-right individuals’ grievance language (violence, hate, paranoia, etc.) significantly differs from the moderates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="signals-of-ideology" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Signals of Ideology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In online social settings, researchers face numerous barriers that prevent using traditional methods.
Directly asking users for their ideologies has dubious success, infringes on platform T&amp;amp;Cs, and does not scale to online populations.
Inferring users’ ideologies from their activity also does not scale as the data requires is prohibitively expensive and tedious to compile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, to reduce expert labor to feasible levels, researchers infer ideologies from signals in user behavior – such as whether they use political hashtags, retweet politicians, or follow political parties.
We dub these signals &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, these &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> for online users can still require laborious labeling by context-specific experts.
For example, the hashtag &lt;em>#ScottyFromMarketing&lt;/em> requires an up-to-date expert in Australian politics to uncover that it expresses an anti-right-wing ideology.
For many researchers:
- access to contextual experts is difficult,
- labeling of signals is still laborious and expensive,
- and context switches require relabelling (exasperating the above problems).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, such context switches are commonplace, as the context changes with time, country, or social platform.
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:teaser">1&lt;/a> showcases the problem: most commonly used &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> can only be transferred in narrow circumstances (represented by the green dotted regions).
For example, following political parties is country-dependent, politicians come and go with time, and hashtags are platform-dependent.
As such, we desire an &lt;em>ideological proxy&lt;/em> that is robust to changes in context, requires no expert labeling and is true to the gold standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:teaser">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="teaser_v2.svg" alt="Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 1: Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Not all ideological proxies can context-switch](teaser.png) -->
&lt;p>Furthermore, the &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> are often sparse among users; however, we would ideally like to detect influence amongst the entire population of users (as taking only active users could bias our inferences).
We further desire a method for inferring the ideology of (potentially inactive) users without direct &lt;em>ideological proxy&lt;/em> information.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="our-solution-you-are-what-you-browse" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Our Solution: You are what you browse&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our solution is a large-scale end-to-end ideology detection pipeline that can be used to profile entire populations of users.
The solution has two main components; the media proxy and the inference architecture.
The media proxy allows for labeling a subset of users, and the inference architecture allows for propagating these labels to the remaining users via socially-informed homophilic lenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="the-media-proxy" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>The Media Proxy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the first part of our work, we generate a proxy based on media-sharing behavior, which satisfies the desiderata.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We generate the media proxy via two media slant datasets (although many are widely available).
The first is an extensive survey of media consumption behaviors conducted by Reuters &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-newman2019reuters" role="doc-biblioref">Newman et al. 2019&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> in several countries in 2020 and 2021.
Participants reported the media publications they consume and their own political ideology.
We estimate the slant of a media source for each country and year as the average ideology of the participants who consume it.
The second dataset is the Allsides Media Bias Dataset &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-sides2018media" role="doc-biblioref">Sides 2018&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which contains an expert-curated set of media publications.
The Allsides dataset contains mostly American-based media; conversely, Reuters covers the major media outlets in each country.
Given that each country and period will have a different conception of ideologies, we calibrate Reuter’s media slants to approximate the Allsides (minimizing the mean-squared error). Figure &lt;a href="#fig:slants">2&lt;/a> shows the slants for each media website within the Reuters dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:slants">&lt;/span>

&lt;!-- ![The slants for various media websites](./url_slants.png) -->
&lt;!-- We finally define the media slant of a media website, as its average over the country, year, and sources, and -->
&lt;p>Finally, we quantify a user’s ideology as the average ideology of their shared media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The media proxy resolves the issue of context switching; since it is applicable across many contexts and can be used widely in a fully automated fashion.
This allows us to create an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We further define methods to classify far-right users from their media-sharing behaviors, which we fully describe in the paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-inference-architecture" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>The Inference Architecture&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the second part of our work, we define an inference architecture that allows inferring the ideological labels of the remaining users – e.g., users who do not share any URLs.
Our inference architecture relies on the sociological principle of homophily, where we hypothesize that similar users will share a similar ideology.
We measure homophily through three distinct lenses;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lexical&lt;/em>: Users with similar language will have similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Hashtag&lt;/em>: Users who participate in similar topics of discussion share a similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Resharing&lt;/em>: Users who consume similar content (signaled via resharing of other users) will share a similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Through these lenses, we utilize an AutoML model, FLAML &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-wang2021flaml" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> (with the LightGBM architecture), trained on users identified via an ideological proxy to propagate the labels to the remaining users and generate a complete ideological profile for a dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-data" class="section level2">

&lt;div id="psychosocial-profiles-of-the-ideological-groups" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>Psychosocial profiles of the Ideological Groups&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Large-scale profiling of entire online populations gives us significant insights into the characteristics of online populations.
We apply our inferred ideological labels of online users in two critical ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>We derive a method for distinguishing the left and the right in terms of their moral language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We derive a method for distinguishing moderate and extreme ideologies in terms of their grievance language.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distinguishing Left and Right&lt;/strong>:
We utilize the FrameAxis &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-mokhberian2020moral" role="doc-biblioref">Mokhberian et al. 2020&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> methodology to metricize each user’s association with each of the five Moral Foundations &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-graham2013moral" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al. 2013&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> in terms of their vice and virtue axes.
Given the measures of the Moral Foundations in the user language, we can start to detect in what way the left and the right differ.
To do this, we find each ideological group’s mean vice and virtue scores and compare these to the neutral group.
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:mft">3&lt;/a> shows the outcome of this analysis on the SocialSense dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:mft">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="mft_diff_plot.svg" alt="Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 3: Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Plot showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language](mft_diff_plot.png) -->
&lt;p>We see that the left prefers the language of virtue, while the right prefers the language of vice.
This trend is largely consistent across all datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distinguishing Moderates and Extremes&lt;/strong>: We similarly generate measures via the Grievance Dictionary &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-van2021grievance" role="doc-biblioref">Van der Vegt et al. 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, a threat assessment tool designed to highlight potential threats through their language.
Similar to the previous plot, we investigate the distribution of grievance scores for the ideological groups.
However, here we measure the difference between distributions with the Signed KL-divergence (a measure of the difference in the location and shape of distributions).
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:grievance">4&lt;/a> shows the results for the Ausvotes dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:grievance">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="grievance_diff_plot.svg" alt="Plot of the grievance categories of ideological groups in the #Ausvotes dataset, showing that the far-right is significantly different." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 4: Plot of the grievance categories of ideological groups in the #Ausvotes dataset, showing that the far-right is significantly different.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Plot showing that the far-right use grievance language](grievance_diff_plot.png) -->
&lt;p>We observe that the far-right’s usage of grievance language is significantly different from the moderate ideological groups.
This adds evidence to the growing concern that members of the far-right may vent their frustration and participate in violent behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this work, we build a fully automatic end-to-end ideology detection pipeline for left-right and far-right detection.
Importantly, with the pipeline, we can show the differences between the left and right, and moderates and extremes in terms of psychosocial language, across a range of diverse datasets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Say you are looking for a new job. You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476">new study&lt;/a> of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don't know well enough to share a personal connection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strength-of-weak-ties">The strength of weak ties&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1973, the American sociologist &lt;a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mark-granovetter">Mark Granovetter&lt;/a> coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086%2F225469">the strength of weak ties&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weak-ties-and-jobs">Weak ties and jobs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Granovetter's theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform's &amp;ldquo;People You May Know&amp;rdquo; recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this &amp;ldquo;A/B testing&amp;rdquo; to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many &amp;ldquo;job transmissions&amp;rdquo; occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moderately-weak-ties-are-best">Moderately weak ties are best&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What's a &amp;ldquo;moderately&amp;rdquo; weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-recommendations">Better recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter's theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-black-boxes">The power of black boxes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28051930">Facebook's infamous emotion experiment of 2014&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, could LinkedIn's experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the &amp;ldquo;strong link&amp;rdquo; treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
