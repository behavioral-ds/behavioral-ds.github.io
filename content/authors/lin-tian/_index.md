# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: I am a Ph.D. student from the Computational Media Lab at the Research School of Computer Science of The Australian National University and affiliated with Data61, CSIRO. I am supervised by Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu, Prof Lexing Xie and Dr Stephen Wan. My current research focuses on modeling information diffusion in social media. Specifically, I am working on understanding the connection between epidemic models and self-exciting point processes and quantifying online diffusions with tools from the connection. 
bio: |
  I'm a geek at heart and a researcher by training.
  My work lives at the intersection of AI, natural language processing, and social computing ‚Äî with a particular obsession for understanding how misinformation spreads and how we might stop it.
  I hold a PhD in Computer Science, and my research blends causal inference, transformer models, state-space models, and multi-agent systems (with a dash of adversarial trolls ü§ñ).

  By day, I build explainable, robust deep learning models ‚Äî including transformer-based architectures and large language models ‚Äî to detect propaganda, coordinated manipulation, and misinformation online.  

  By night (and often still by day), I write code, run experiments, and hack together visualizations to trace how information evolves across the web üßë‚Äçüíªüìä.
