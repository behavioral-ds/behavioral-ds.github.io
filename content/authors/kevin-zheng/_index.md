bio: |
  I’m a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, working with Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu in the Behavioral Data Science Lab. My research dives into how information spreads online and how to make machine learning models a little more robust when faced with the messiness of the real world.  

  Before starting my PhD, I studied at the University of Sydney, where I somehow graduated with a University Medal (still not sure how that happened). Along the way, I taught data science and machine learning courses, and discovered that explaining tough concepts to students is one of the best ways to truly understand them myself.  

  Outside academia, I’m usually carrying a film camera, hunting for the perfect cup of coffee, or sweating it out at the gym. I also enjoy picking up new activities, from dusting off my archery gear to hoping for chances to try diving or skydiving. When I travel, I tend to wander off-plan and usually end up chasing good food and even better coffee.  

  If you’d like to talk about research, photography, or the eternal debate over the best flat white in Sydney, feel free to reach out!
