bio: 
 I’m a Ph.D. student at the University of Technology Sydney, supervised by Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. My research focuses on understanding the human factors that drive the spread of misinformation and exploring how we can effectively mitigate it.


 Before joining the Behavioral Data Science Lab, I worked as a Data Development Engineer at the fintech company Alipay, where I helped build an LLM-powered data asset agent to improve how users search for and interact with data resources. I’ve also interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at TikTok and Didi Global. At TikTok, I worked on boosting recommendations for long-tail, high-quality videos using NLP techniques to support a healthier content ecosystem. At Didi, I contributed to implement strategies using ML models aimed at improving user engagement within the e-commerce recommendation system.
 

 Outside of work, I’m passionate about the outdoors—whether it’s rock climbing, hiking, or diving (scuba or free diving), I’m always up for an adventure.


 If you're interested in my research or want to connect over outdoor activities, feel free to reach out on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FuHuixiang)**.
