anonymous 4chan user made a cryptic post claiming Hillary Clinton would be arrested within days. Four years later, on January 6, 2021, devotees of the QAnon conspiracy theory - which originated from that very post - stormed the U.S. Capitol in an act that left five people dead and over 140 police officers injured.\nThis tragic event underscores a critical question:\nWhat if we could have seen this coming?\nToday, we're introducing IC-Mamba, a state-of-the-art model that can forecast social media engagement patterns and detect viral misinformation before it spirals out of control. By modeling the complex temporal dynamics of how content spreads online, IC-Mamba achieves unprecedented accuracy in predicting which posts will go viral - often within just 15-30 minutes of publication.\nPaper citation:\nTian, L., Booth, E., Bailo, F., Droogan, J. and Rizoiu, M.A., 2025, April.

(see full paper here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3696410.3714527)\nThe Challenge: Understanding Interval-Censored Social Media Data Social media platforms don't provide continuous streams of engagement data. Instead, they offer snapshots at irregular intervals - what we call \u0026ldquo;interval-censored\u0026rdquo; data. As illustrated in Figure 1, while users interact with content continuously, platforms only report cumulative counts at discrete observation points.\nFigure 1. Illustration of interval-censored social media engagement data. \nThis creates unique challenges:\n Irregular sampling: Observation intervals vary from minutes to hours Cumulative counts: We only see totals, not individual actions Multi-scale dynamics: Engagement patterns evolve from rapid initial spread to long-term influence  IC-Mamba: A Novel Architecture for Early Detection IC-Mamba combines three key components to tackle these challenges:\n1. Time-Aware Positional Embeddings We developed a dual encoding strategy that captures both relative and absolute temporal relationships:\nRelative Temporal Encoding (RTE):\nRTE(t, t_ref) = sin((t - t_ref) / σ)\nAbsolute Temporal Encoding (ATE):\nATE(t) = [sin(t/10000^(2i/d)), cos(t/10000^(2i/d))]\nThese embeddings are then modulated by observed engagement levels, allowing the model to learn characteristic temporal patterns associated with different levels of social impact.\n2. Interval-Censored State Space Modeling We extend the Mamba architecture to handle varying-length censored intervals through:\n Interval-aware vectors that encode time gaps and engagement counts Time-dependent state transitions using matrix exponentials Selective state processing through parallel pathways  Figure 2. Overview of the IC-Mamba Architecture. \n3. Two-Tier Architecture As shown in Figure 3, IC-Mamba uses a hierarchical approach:\n Tier 1: Models individual post engagement dynamics Tier 2: Captures temporal interactions between posts sharing the same opinion  Figure 3. Overview of the Two-Tier IC-Mamba Architecture. \nHow IC-Mamba Works Post-Level Engagement Prediction IC-Mamba's post-level prediction capabilities stem from its sophisticated handling of temporal dynamics and multi-modal information integration:\n1. Unified Sequence Representation\nThe model creates a comprehensive embedding for each post by combining:\nSE(p) = Encoder([CLS] ⊕ [text] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [user] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [timeline] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [engagement])\nThis allows IC-Mamba to jointly learn from textual content, user metadata, and temporal engagement patterns in a single unified framework.\n2. Interval-Aware State Processing\nFor each observation time, the model constructs an interval-aware vector that captures:\n Time since last observation (Δt⁻) Current engagement levels (log(1 + e)) Forward interval length (Δt⁺) Predicted next engagement  This rich representation enables the model to understand not just what happened, but when and how quickly it occurred.\n3. Adaptive State Transitions\nThe state space model adapts to varying observation intervals through:\nA_t(Δt) = exp(Δt · Ã_t)\nThis matrix exponential formulation allows smooth interpolation across irregular time gaps, maintaining temporal coherence even with sparse observations.\nOpinion-Level Classification IC-Mamba's exceptional performance in identifying misinformation narratives comes from its two-tier architecture and sophisticated temporal modeling:\n1. Learning Opinion Signatures\nThe first tier (IC-Mamba₁) processes individual posts to learn characteristic engagement patterns for different opinion types. Posts expressing similar opinions often exhibit similar temporal dynamics - for instance, conspiracy theories might show rapid initial spread followed by sustained engagement from dedicated communities.\n2. Capturing Narrative Evolution\nThe second tier (IC-Mamba₂) models how opinions spread across multiple posts:\nz_o = IC-Mamba₂((h_i, δt_i))\nWhere:\n h_i: Hidden representations from individual posts δt_i: Time intervals between posts expressing the same opinion  This allows the model to identify coordinated campaigns where multiple accounts push similar narratives with strategic timing.\n3. Multi-Scale Temporal Features\nThe model learns to distinguish between:\n Organic discussions: Natural ebb and flow of engagement, constrained by human attention limits Coordinated campaigns: Artificial amplification patterns, strategic timing, and sustained engagement beyond natural thresholds  4. Context-Aware Classification\nUnlike text-only approaches (like BERT), IC-Mamba incorporates:\n Engagement velocity (how quickly reactions accumulate) User network effects (who's sharing and when) Temporal coordination (synchronized posting patterns) Cross-platform dynamics (when available)  This multi-faceted approach explains why IC-Mamba achieves F1 scores of 0.69-0.75 on organic content and maintains 0.51 performance even on sophisticated disinformation campaigns where text-only models fail dramatically.\nUnderstanding Engagement Patterns: Misinformation vs. Disinformation Figure 4 reveals differences between misinformation discussions and coordinated campaigns:\nFigure 4: Engagement distribution patterns. \nMisinformation content (Climate Change):\n Follows human-scale constraints (~150 stable connections - Dunbar's number) Plateaus around 10³ engagements Uniform decay across engagement types  Coordinated campaigns (DiN):\n Transcends natural limits, reaching 10⁶ engagements Marked stratification, especially in likes Self-similar temporal behavior across all observation windows  Real-World Impact: Tracking \u0026ldquo;Climate Change is a UN Hoax\u0026rdquo; Figure 5: Early prediction performance on \"Climate Change is a UN Hoax\". \nFigure 5a and 5b showcase IC-Mamba's ability to forecast opinion-level engagement over 28 days:\n 7-day observation window: Predictions remain accurate with wider confidence intervals 10-day observation window: Tighter confidence bands and improved long-term accuracy Multi-engagement tracking: Simultaneously forecasts likes, comments, shares, and emoji reactions  Technical Deep Dive: The Mathematics Behind IC-Mamba State Space Formulation The model uses time-dependent state transitions:\nA_t(Δt) = exp(Δt · Ã_t) ∈ ℝ^(D_h × D_h) h_t = A_t(Δt)h_{t-1} + B_t x_t y_t = C_t^T h_t\nWhere:\n h_t: Hidden state at time t Δt: Interval between observations exp(Δt · Ã_t): Matrix exponential for smooth interpolation  Loss Functions We combine two objectives for robust training:\nEngagement Prediction Loss:\nL_pred = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||ê_{j+1} - e_{j+1}||²\nTemporal Coherence Loss:\nL_temp = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||h_{j+1} - exp(Δt_j^+ · Ã_t)h_j||²\nConclusion: A Tool for Digital Defense IC-Mamba shows our ability to detect and predict the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. By providing early warnings \u0026ndash; often within 15-30 minutes of posting \u0026ndash; it offers platforms and researchers crucial time to:\n Identify potentially harmful content before mass exposure Track coordinated information operations in real-time Design and implement targeted countermeasures Protect democratic discourse from manipulation  As misinformation continues to threaten social cohesion and democratic institutions, tools like IC-Mamba become essential components of our digital defense infrastructure. The model's ability to distinguish between organic discussions and coordinated campaigns, combined with its early detection capabilities, makes it a powerful ally in the fight against online manipulation.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/ltian678/ic-mamba, and an interactive dashboard demonstrating the results can be accessed at https://ic-mamba.behavioral-ds.science/.\n ","date":1750377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1750377600,"objectID":"65af5c63e6489f3047001033a23a83be","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/blogpost/ic-mamba/","publishdate":"2025-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blogpost/ic-mamba/","section":"blogpost","summary":"We present IC-Mamba, a state space model that that forecasts social media engagement by modeling intervalcensored data with integrated temporal embeddings.","tags":[],"title":"Before It's Too Late: A State Space Model for the Early Prediction of Misinformation and Disinformation Engagement","type":"blogpost"},{"authors":["Lin Tian"],"categories":["Research","blogpost"],"content":"Introduction: From 4chan to Capitol - When Online Conspiracies Turn Deadly On October 28, 2017, an anonymous 4chan user made a cryptic post claiming Hillary Clinton would be arrested within days.

Learning Opinion Signatures\nThe first tier (IC-Mamba₁) processes individual posts to learn characteristic engagement patterns for different opinion types. Posts expressing similar opinions often exhibit similar temporal dynamics - for instance, conspiracy theories might show rapid initial spread followed by sustained engagement from dedicated communities.\n2. Capturing Narrative Evolution\nThe second tier (IC-Mamba₂) models how opinions spread across multiple posts:\nz_o = IC-Mamba₂((h_i, δt_i))\nWhere:\n h_i: Hidden representations from individual posts δt_i: Time intervals between posts expressing the same opinion  This allows the model to identify coordinated campaigns where multiple accounts push similar narratives with strategic timing.\n3. Multi-Scale Temporal Features\nThe model learns to distinguish between:\n Organic discussions: Natural ebb and flow of engagement, constrained by human attention limits Coordinated campaigns: Artificial amplification patterns, strategic timing, and sustained engagement beyond natural thresholds  4. Context-Aware Classification\nUnlike text-only approaches (like BERT), IC-Mamba incorporates:\n Engagement velocity (how quickly reactions accumulate) User network effects (who's sharing and when) Temporal coordination (synchronized posting patterns) Cross-platform dynamics (when available)  This multi-faceted approach explains why IC-Mamba achieves F1 scores of 0.69-0.75 on organic content and maintains 0.51 performance even on sophisticated disinformation campaigns where text-only models fail dramatically.\nUnderstanding Engagement Patterns: Misinformation vs. Disinformation Figure 4 reveals differences between misinformation discussions and coordinated campaigns:\nFigure 4: Engagement distribution patterns. \nMisinformation content (Climate Change):\n Follows human-scale constraints (~150 stable connections - Dunbar's number) Plateaus around 10³ engagements Uniform decay across engagement types  Coordinated campaigns (DiN):\n Transcends natural limits, reaching 10⁶ engagements Marked stratification, especially in likes Self-similar temporal behavior across all observation windows  Real-World Impact: Tracking \u0026ldquo;Climate Change is a UN Hoax\u0026rdquo; Figure 5: Early prediction performance on \"Climate Change is a UN Hoax\". \nFigure 5a and 5b showcase IC-Mamba's ability to forecast opinion-level engagement over 28 days:\n 7-day observation window: Predictions remain accurate with wider confidence intervals 10-day observation window: Tighter confidence bands and improved long-term accuracy Multi-engagement tracking: Simultaneously forecasts likes, comments, shares, and emoji reactions  Technical Deep Dive: The Mathematics Behind IC-Mamba State Space Formulation The model uses time-dependent state transitions:\nA_t(Δt) = exp(Δt · Ã_t) ∈ ℝ^(D_h × D_h) h_t = A_t(Δt)h_{t-1} + B_t x_t y_t = C_t^T h_t\nWhere:\n h_t: Hidden state at time t Δt: Interval between observations exp(Δt · Ã_t): Matrix exponential for smooth interpolation  Loss Functions We combine two objectives for robust training:\nEngagement Prediction Loss:\nL_pred = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||ê_{j+1} - e_{j+1}||²\nTemporal Coherence Loss:\nL_temp = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||h_{j+1} - exp(Δt_j^+ · Ã_t)h_j||²\nConclusion: A Tool for Digital Defense IC-Mamba shows our ability to detect and predict the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. By providing early warnings \u0026ndash; often within 15-30 minutes of posting \u0026ndash; it offers platforms and researchers crucial time to:\n Identify potentially harmful content before mass exposure Track coordinated information operations in real-time Design and implement targeted countermeasures Protect democratic discourse from manipulation  As misinformation continues to threaten social cohesion and democratic institutions, tools like IC-Mamba become essential components of our digital defense infrastructure. The model's ability to distinguish between organic discussions and coordinated campaigns, combined with its early detection capabilities, makes it a powerful ally in the fight against online manipulation.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/ltian678/ic-mamba, and an interactive dashboard demonstrating the results can be accessed at https://ic-mamba.behavioral-ds.science/.\n ","date":1750377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1750377600,"objectID":"e49f7d5084acf6da325a94c9fedee55c","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme2_content/ic-mamba/","publishdate":"2025-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/theme2_content/ic-mamba/","section":"theme2_content","summary":"We present IC-Mamba, a state space model that that forecasts social media engagement by modeling intervalcensored data with integrated temporal embeddings.","tags":[],"title":"Before It's Too Late: A State Space Model for the Early Prediction of Misinformation and Disinformation Engagement","type":"theme2_content"},{"authors":["Lanqin (Frankie) Yuan"],"categories":["Research","blogpost"],"content":"This is a repost of our article from The Conversation.\nPaper citation:\nLanqin Yuan, Philipp J.

Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.\nIn this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.\nPaper citation:\nCalderon, Pio, Rohit Ram, and Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. \u0026quot;Opinion Market Model: Stemming Far-Right Opinion Spread using Positive Interventions.\u0026quot; In International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2024.  (see full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06620.pdf)\nInterventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].\nEvaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.\nOur Solution: The Opinion Market Model The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions\u0026rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users\u0026rsquo; attention in the online realm.\nFigure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.\nOMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).\nIn terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \\(S(t)\\) (gray) and interventions \\(X(t)\\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.\nThe first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity. The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.\nDatasets We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.\nBushfire Opinions dataset. The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:\nGreens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires. Mainstream media cannot be trusted. Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax. Australian bushfires and climate change are not related. Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists. Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.  To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \\({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, \u0026hellip; , 5}}\\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.\nThe exogenous signal \\(S(t)\\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query \u0026ldquo;bushfire+climate change\u0026rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \\({X_k(t)}\\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].\nVEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset. We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \\(S_i(t)\\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \\({X_k(t)}\\).\nPredicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.\nFigure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.\nFig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.\nUncovering Latent Opinion Interactions To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.\nFigure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.\nBushfire Opinions. Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.\nThe results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists\u0026rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like \u0026ldquo;Climate change is real\u0026rdquo; (2-) and \u0026ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires\u0026rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists\u0026rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion \u0026ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia\u0026rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger \u0026ldquo;Climate change is real\u0026rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.\nVEVO Artists. We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris\u0026rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.\nOMM as a Testbed for Interventions Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.\nWe can leverage the OMM in a \u0026ldquo;what-if\u0026rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.\nFigure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.\nFigure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \\({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\\) separately. For Facebook, reputable news generally suppresses far-right opinions and most controversial news reinforces them, except for certain topics like \u0026ldquo;Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires\u0026rdquo; (\\(R_0\\)) and \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by arsonists.\u0026rdquo; (\\(R_4\\)) On Twitter, both reputable and controversial news suppress far-right opinions, except for reputable news related to certain topics.\nThe insights are twofold: firstly, Facebook's effect is moderate compared to Twitter due to Facebook's filter bubble nature. Secondly, indiscriminately increasing reputable news on Twitter can be ineffective and even counterproductive as it might attract more attention to far-right narratives and users (see \\(R_3\\) and \\(R_4\\)) [22].\nReferences [1] Wu, S.; Rizoiu, M.-A.; and Xie, L. 2019.

Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.\nIn this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.\nPaper citation:\nCalderon, Pio, Rohit Ram, and Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. \u0026quot;Opinion Market Model: Stemming Far-Right Opinion Spread using Positive Interventions.\u0026quot; In International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2024.  (see full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06620.pdf)\nInterventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].\nEvaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.\nOur Solution: The Opinion Market Model The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions\u0026rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users\u0026rsquo; attention in the online realm.\nFigure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.\nOMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).\nIn terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \\(S(t)\\) (gray) and interventions \\(X(t)\\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.\nThe first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity. The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.\nDatasets We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.\nBushfire Opinions dataset. The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:\nGreens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires. Mainstream media cannot be trusted. Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax. Australian bushfires and climate change are not related. Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists. Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.  To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \\({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, \u0026hellip; , 5}}\\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.\nThe exogenous signal \\(S(t)\\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query \u0026ldquo;bushfire+climate change\u0026rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \\({X_k(t)}\\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].\nVEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset. We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \\(S_i(t)\\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \\({X_k(t)}\\).\nPredicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.\nFigure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.\nFig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.\nUncovering Latent Opinion Interactions To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.\nFigure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.\nBushfire Opinions. Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.\nThe results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists\u0026rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like \u0026ldquo;Climate change is real\u0026rdquo; (2-) and \u0026ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires\u0026rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists\u0026rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion \u0026ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia\u0026rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger \u0026ldquo;Climate change is real\u0026rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.\nVEVO Artists. We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris\u0026rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.\nOMM as a Testbed for Interventions Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.\nWe can leverage the OMM in a \u0026ldquo;what-if\u0026rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.\nFigure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.\nFigure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \\({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\\) separately. For Facebook, reputable news generally suppresses far-right opinions and most controversial news reinforces them, except for certain topics like \u0026ldquo;Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires\u0026rdquo; (\\(R_0\\)) and \u0026ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by arsonists.\u0026rdquo; (\\(R_4\\)) On Twitter, both reputable and controversial news suppress far-right opinions, except for reputable news related to certain topics.\nThe insights are twofold: firstly, Facebook's effect is moderate compared to Twitter due to Facebook's filter bubble nature. Secondly, indiscriminately increasing reputable news on Twitter can be ineffective and even counterproductive as it might attract more attention to far-right narratives and users (see \\(R_3\\) and \\(R_4\\)) [22].\nReferences [1] Wu, S.; Rizoiu, M.-A.; and Xie, L. 2019.

The pipeline fills a crucial gap by providing flexible methodology and tooling for understanding ideologies and building early warning systems for extreme ideology-motivated (and potentially violent) activity.\nPaper citation:\nRam, R. and Rizoiu, M.A., 2022. You are what you browse: A robust framework for uncovering political ideology. arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.04097. (see full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04097.pdf)\nIdeology in an Online World Ideology determines how we make sense of much of the world, our opinions, and our political actions. It is not a new concept; throughout history, it served as the context for unrest. However, ideological spread and radicalization have entered a new paradigm in our ever-connected world. The internet is a significant source of information and spreads opinions quickly through social platforms. In particular, the anonymity and lack of accountability often associated with online communication set up a supportive environment for spreading far-right ideologies and radicalizing individuals into extremist groups. Far-right extremism is a form of ideology that advocates for ultranationalism, racism, and opposition to immigration and multiculturalism. These ideologies strongly correlate with violence and terrorism and threaten individual and collective security.\nThe Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raised concerns about Australians being radicalized very young and the rise of extremist movements in Australia through online technologies (“Director-General’s Annual Threat Assessment” 2021). ASIO claimed that during the COVID period, 30-40% of their caseload was devoted to far-right extremism, up from 10-15% in 2016 (Karp 2020).\nUnfortunately, Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE) continues to be an issue in Australia. On December 12th, 2022, two Queensland police officers were killed while performing routine duties (Gillespie and McGowan 2022). Later investigations would uncover that the three people, who killed the officers, were active online in producing deep-state and religious conspiratorial content. Their content has since been removed from mainstream social platforms but continues to be shared on conspiratorial websites. Such extreme-leaning content often serves as a lead indicator of violent extremism (as was the case in this incident and the Christchurch Mosque Shootings three years prior). However, the tools to identify and understand the psychosocial characteristics of these extreme individuals and communities are lacking.\nIn this work, we build an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline and psychosocial profiles of ideological groups. We find that right-leaning individuals tend to use moral-vice language more than left-leaning and that far-right individuals’ grievance language (violence, hate, paranoia, etc.) significantly differs from the moderates.\n Signals of Ideology In online social settings, researchers face numerous barriers that prevent using traditional methods. Directly asking users for their ideologies has dubious success, infringes on platform T\u0026amp;Cs, and does not scale to online populations. Inferring users’ ideologies from their activity also does not scale as the data requires is prohibitively expensive and tedious to compile.\nInstead, to reduce expert labor to feasible levels, researchers infer ideologies from signals in user behavior – such as whether they use political hashtags, retweet politicians, or follow political parties. We dub these signals ideological proxies.\nImportantly, these ideological proxies for online users can still require laborious labeling by context-specific experts. For example, the hashtag #ScottyFromMarketing requires an up-to-date expert in Australian politics to uncover that it expresses an anti-right-wing ideology. For many researchers: - access to contextual experts is difficult, - labeling of signals is still laborious and expensive, - and context switches require relabelling (exasperating the above problems).\nUnfortunately, such context switches are commonplace, as the context changes with time, country, or social platform. Figure 1 showcases the problem: most commonly used ideological proxies can only be transferred in narrow circumstances (represented by the green dotted regions). For example, following political parties is country-dependent, politicians come and go with time, and hashtags are platform-dependent. As such, we desire an ideological proxy that is robust to changes in context, requires no expert labeling and is true to the gold standard.\n Figure 1: Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch.  Furthermore, the ideological proxies are often sparse among users; however, we would ideally like to detect influence amongst the entire population of users (as taking only active users could bias our inferences). We further desire a method for inferring the ideology of (potentially inactive) users without direct ideological proxy information.\n Our Solution: You are what you browse Our solution is a large-scale end-to-end ideology detection pipeline that can be used to profile entire populations of users. The solution has two main components; the media proxy and the inference architecture. The media proxy allows for labeling a subset of users, and the inference architecture allows for propagating these labels to the remaining users via socially-informed homophilic lenses.\nThe Media Proxy For the first part of our work, we generate a proxy based on media-sharing behavior, which satisfies the desiderata.\nWe generate the media proxy via two media slant datasets (although many are widely available). The first is an extensive survey of media consumption behaviors conducted by Reuters (Newman et al. 2019) in several countries in 2020 and 2021. Participants reported the media publications they consume and their own political ideology. We estimate the slant of a media source for each country and year as the average ideology of the participants who consume it. The second dataset is the Allsides Media Bias Dataset (Sides 2018), which contains an expert-curated set of media publications. The Allsides dataset contains mostly American-based media; conversely, Reuters covers the major media outlets in each country. Given that each country and period will have a different conception of ideologies, we calibrate Reuter’s media slants to approximate the Allsides (minimizing the mean-squared error). Figure 2 shows the slants for each media website within the Reuters dataset.\n Figure 2: Plot showing the slants for various media websites.  Finally, we quantify a user’s ideology as the average ideology of their shared media.\nThe media proxy resolves the issue of context switching; since it is applicable across many contexts and can be used widely in a fully automated fashion. This allows us to create an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline.\nWe further define methods to classify far-right users from their media-sharing behaviors, which we fully describe in the paper.\n The Inference Architecture In the second part of our work, we define an inference architecture that allows inferring the ideological labels of the remaining users – e.g., users who do not share any URLs. Our inference architecture relies on the sociological principle of homophily, where we hypothesize that similar users will share a similar ideology. We measure homophily through three distinct lenses;\nLexical: Users with similar language will have similar ideology Hashtag: Users who participate in similar topics of discussion share a similar ideology Resharing: Users who consume similar content (signaled via resharing of other users) will share a similar ideology  Through these lenses, we utilize an AutoML model, FLAML (Wang et al. 2021) (with the LightGBM architecture), trained on users identified via an ideological proxy to propagate the labels to the remaining users and generate a complete ideological profile for a dataset.\n  The Data We utilize several large-scale datasets from various platforms to showcase the relative ease of applying our end-to-end pipeline. The datasets’ characteristics are described in Table 1.  Table 1: The datasets used through-out the analysis, with the number of users, posts, and affliated country.  Dataset Users Posts Country    #Qanda 103,074 768,808 AUS  #Ausvotes 273,874 5,033,982 AUS  #SocialSense 49,442 358,292 AUS  Riot 574,281 1,067,794 US  Parler 120,048 603,820 US    Psychosocial profiles of the Ideological Groups Large-scale profiling of entire online populations gives us significant insights into the characteristics of online populations. We apply our inferred ideological labels of online users in two critical ways:\nWe derive a method for distinguishing the left and the right in terms of their moral language. We derive a method for distinguishing moderate and extreme ideologies in terms of their grievance language.  Distinguishing Left and Right: We utilize the FrameAxis (Mokhberian et al. 2020) methodology to metricize each user’s association with each of the five Moral Foundations (Graham et al. 2013) in terms of their vice and virtue axes. Given the measures of the Moral Foundations in the user language, we can start to detect in what way the left and the right differ. To do this, we find each ideological group’s mean vice and virtue scores and compare these to the neutral group. Figure 3 shows the outcome of this analysis on the SocialSense dataset.\n Figure 3: Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language.  We see that the left prefers the language of virtue, while the right prefers the language of vice. This trend is largely consistent across all datasets.\nDistinguishing Moderates and Extremes: We similarly generate measures via the Grievance Dictionary (Van der Vegt et al. 2021), a threat assessment tool designed to highlight potential threats through their language. Similar to the previous plot, we investigate the distribution of grievance scores for the ideological groups. However, here we measure the difference between distributions with the Signed KL-divergence (a measure of the difference in the location and shape of distributions). Figure 4 shows the results for the Ausvotes dataset.\n Figure 4: Plot of the grievance categories of ideological groups in the #Ausvotes dataset, showing that the far-right is significantly different.  We observe that the far-right’s usage of grievance language is significantly different from the moderate ideological groups. This adds evidence to the growing concern that members of the far-right may vent their frustration and participate in violent behavior.\n  Conclusion In this work, we build a fully automatic end-to-end ideology detection pipeline for left-right and far-right detection. Importantly, with the pipeline, we can show the differences between the left and right, and moderates and extremes in terms of psychosocial language, across a range of diverse datasets.\nReferences “Director-General’s Annual Threat Assessment.” 2021.

You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network.\nBut who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A new study of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don't know well enough to share a personal connection with.\nThe strength of weak ties In 1973, the American sociologist Mark Granovetter coined the phrase \u0026ldquo;the strength of weak ties\u0026rdquo; in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.\nSimply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance.\nSo if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.\nWeak ties and jobs Granovetter's theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.\nTheir research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform's \u0026ldquo;People You May Know\u0026rdquo; recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.\nOne of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this \u0026ldquo;A/B testing\u0026rdquo; to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.\nMore than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.\nNext, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many \u0026ldquo;job transmissions\u0026rdquo; occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.\nModerately weak ties are best The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings.\nFirst, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links.\nSecond, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What's a \u0026ldquo;moderately\u0026rdquo; weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact.\nThird, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.\nBetter recommendations This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter's theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox.\nThis study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.\nFrom a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly.\nThese can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.\nThe power of black boxes The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see Facebook's infamous emotion experiment of 2014).\nSo, could LinkedIn's experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the \u0026ldquo;strong link\u0026rdquo; treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job.\nHowever, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.\nNonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.\n","date":1663545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663545600,"objectID":"cceb019a15f9009c795afc43e3dad02f","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme3_content/linkedin_experiment/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/theme3_content/linkedin_experiment/","section":"theme3_content","summary":"LinkedIn's most recent experiment shows a causal relation between weak link formation and job mobility.","tags":null,"title":"Acquaintances beat close friends for job connections, huge LinkedIn study shows","type":"theme3_content"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu"],"categories":["Research","Post"],"content":"Your browser does not support iFrames.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic alerted the world to complex issues that arise from social media platforms circulating user-generated misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories [2]. There are several primary types of quantitative methods for addressing problematic information, including large-scale monitoring of social media datasets [3], understanding platforms, users, and networks contributing to the \u0026ldquo;infodemic\u0026rdquo; [4], and predicting future pathways of information spreading [5]. These studies provide valuable insights into understanding how problematic information spreads and detecting which sources are reshared frequently and by which accounts. However, these approaches often have less to say about why certain opinions and views gain traction with vulnerable groups and online communities.\nQualitative research methods are well placed to address this gap. They provide rich, contextual insights into online communities\u0026rsquo; social beliefs, values, and practices, which shape how information is shared and how opinions are formed [6]. Nevertheless, a common criticism of qualitative research is that the in-depth knowledge comes at the expense of generating insights of limited representativeness and weak robustness of the findings. Therefore, there is a gap between the depth of insight gained from ethnographic and qualitative approaches and the breadth of knowledge gained from computational methods from data science.\nOur work fills this gap by proposing a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative insights, large-scale data collection, and human-in-the-loop machine learning approaches. We apply our method to map in-depth and in-breadth the problematic information around four topics: 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, Climate change, COVID-19, and Vaccination on three social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube).\nOur Solution: Mixing Digital Ethnography with Advanced Machine Learning We present a complete solution that bridges and facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis to study problematic online speech. The pipeline consists of three components which are detailed in this section.\nDeep qualitative study The first component is the qualitative study. We build a platform based on an open-source tool, Wikibase, where we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis. Through the quantitative study, we build an ontology of problematic online speech. We label a large number of social media postings using their topics. Simultaneously, we construct a vocabulary of 71 opinions that we also use to label postings. Some example opinions include:\n Climate change crisis isn't real United Nations is corrupt Climate change is a UN hoax United Nations wants to be the global ruling government Vaccines cause Autism The World Health Organisation is corrupt  These opinions contain mistrust in the government and supra-national structures (e.g., UN, WHO) and typical misinformation about vaccines.\nUnlabeled data collection Qualitative approaches analyze emerging content and construct the vocabulary simultaneously when labeling the data. However, they lack representativeness as they tend to be overly concentrated on narrow areas of the narrative landscape. For this reason, the second step in our methodology involves collecting data at scale. We collect large-scale raw data using the uncovered vocabulary from the deep qualitative study. We construct keywords (shown in the table) for each topic to crawl social media data from three platforms. We obtain a total of 13,321,813 postings — 11,437,009 Facebook postings, 1,793,927 tweets and 90,877 YouTube comments.\nDataset augmentation The next step is to annotate all the postings in our dataset automatically. We employ machine learning algorithms to augment the data labeling process with a human-in-the-loop setting.\nBy adopting the state-of-the-art text classification algorithm, RoBERTa [7,8], we first train the classifiers to identify problematic speech on postings annotated by the qualitative researchers. Next, we deploy three strategies to select unlabeled data. The active learning [9] strategy selects the data for which the classifiers are most uncertain. The top-confidence strategy selects data that classifiers are most certain about. The third strategy — the random strategy — randomly samples from unlabeled data. The qualitative researchers then label the sampled data, introduce the newly labeled data in the ontology, and repeat the procedure iteratively until the predictive performance converges.\nHuman-in-the-loop Performance We discuss here the convergence of prediction performance over labeling iterations.\nThe following plot depicts the prediction performance on the test set macro-averaged over topics (accuracy in the left panel and F1 score on the right panel) over iterations. The solid lines show the performance indicators, together with the cross-validation generalization error.\nThe cross-validation performance is stable across iterations. This is expected as the classifiers learn from the same data on which the generalization is estimated — i.e., the classifiers are representative of the data they were trained on. However, the difference between the test set performance and cross-validation performance is indicative of the representativity over the entire dataset. The cross-validation accuracy is consistently lower than the test set accuracy because the test data is more imbalanced than labeled data. The cross-validation F1 is more optimistic than the test set F1. Finally, the difference between the two stabilizes for the later iterations, further suggesting the convergence. Applying the Qualitative Mapping We employ the obtained augmented labeled set to analyze the dynamics of problematic opinions at scale. We machine-label the opinions in a large set of postings spanning over a long time, allowing us to apply the qualitative-defined coding schema to a significantly larger sample of postings. This reduces the unavoidable selection bias of the deep qualitative study. It also offers a critical tool for analyzing co-occurring opinions, which helps identify central opinions. It is common for postings to express multiple opinions.\nWe explore central opinions by building an opinion co-occurrence network in the online conversation of the topic 2019-20 Australian bushfire season. In the network, nodes are the opinions captured during the bushfire conversation, while edges are present when both opinions are detected in the same postings. The node degree of a given opinion node represents the number of opinions that co-occurred with it. The edges are weighted by the number of postings in which their connected node opinions co-occurred.\nThe following plot presents each edge's daily proportions of weights among all edges between September 2019 and January 2020. We show six edges (i.e., opinion pairs) to represent three types of temporal dynamics:\n A continuous and relatively strong association between prevalent opinions — \u0026ldquo;Climate change crisis isn't real\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax,\u0026rdquo; which not notably is a conspiracy theory. Associations with declining relative frequencies — \u0026ldquo;Greta Thunberg should not have a platform or influence as a climate\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Women and girls don't deserve a voice in the public sphere\u0026rdquo;. Rising associations such as \u0026ldquo;bushfires and climate change not related\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bushfires were caused by random arsonists\u0026rdquo;; and also the conspiracy theory associations between \u0026ldquo;United Nations is corrupt\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;United Nations wants to be the global ruling government\u0026rdquo;.   In the following plot, we map the co-occurrence network from posts published over 14 days in late September 2019, i.e., the period when the betweenness for conspiracy opinions is at peak. This figure explains the ambivalent network role that conspiracy opinions can play: we first note a conspiracy opinion with relatively high degree and frequency — \u0026ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax\u0026rdquo; —, while we also observe the presence of low degree but high betweenness conspiracy opinions at the periphery of the network — \u0026ldquo;Bushfires linked to secret elites\u0026rsquo; secret technology (chemtrails, HAARP, HSRN, geoengineering)\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;bushfires deliberately lit to promote a climate change agenda\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Australia should not be a member of the United Nations\u0026rdquo;.\nReferences [1] Jack, C. 2017.

The F5 VPN App should open up in a new window - accept (yes) and the tunnel will open up. \nStep 2 - Access the iHPC (command line) At the command line using use the following command to access the\n# Generic command ssh username@... # Example command for my access ssh jwmurray@ihpc.eng.uts.edu.au  From here you will be asked for your password - input it as normal. \nStep 3 - Connect to a Node in iHPC Now you will be effectively working in a remote computing environment. Use the command cnode to get a list of the nodes within iHPC.\nOnce you have a list of the nodes on the system you can see who is working in which node and what the usage rates are. To access a specific node you will need to have been granted access previously by the iHPC administrator. This is approved through a supervisor. The two nodes available for us to use are:\n hephaestos1 hephaestos2  To connect to one of the nodes the following code is used:\ncnode hephaestos2 # this will give the detail of only this node ssh hephaestos2 # this will actually connect to the node  You now have access to the server environment and can establish a VENV based on this remote server.\nThere are two commands that will help navigation on the system\ncd ~ # This will get you to your own folder (Data and Templates) cd / # This will take you to the root directory where all Data is stored.  The datasets for use are in the Behavioural DS project - the following command will take you there:\ncd /projects/BehavioralDS # Data sets is the folder of interest in this one  You have now opened a ssh tunnel to IHPC, connected to a node and accessed the Data sets in the Behavioural DS project folder on the system. \nStep 4 - Create VENV for Python Best practice is to create a VENV for Python for each project you run. This will enable a requirements file to be created easily for tracking the packages used in the analysis thereby making it easier for others to reproduce your work.\nCreate this VENV in your personal folder for ease. This link has details on how to do this.\nAn example is below:\npython3 -m venv my_env # make sure to use python3 as python2 doesn't have the venv command baked into it. my_env can be whatever you want to call it. Use something unique as it will be referenced when working in jupyter notebooks.  \nStep 5 - Create a Jupyter Notebook host Now the VENV is created (using python 3.6.8 on iHPC) we can start the Jupyter notebook host we will access remotely. Before we can do this we need to install ipython and jupyter into the VENV we jsut created. This blog is a good reference for how to do it.\nOnce the VENV is established activate it with source myenv/bin/activate. Once it is active we need to install iPython and Jupyter via pip3 install ... into the environment we have created.\nOnce we have done this any new packages we need to use as part of the analysis can be loaded with pip3 install (package name). Ideally keep two terminal windows open, one for updated packages as required in the remote environment and one for your local machine. \nStep 6 - Set up Remote Jupyter notebooks You'll need to set up the notebook environment on the remote server then establish the ssh environment then start it up on your local machine. Anything you save will be on the remote server, consider where notebooks are held and how to access them in the future.\nThis blog has the details required to make this work.\nExample code is below:\njupyter notebook --port=9000 --no-browser  If the port is already in use it cycles through increasing by one on the port number until it serves the notebooks. This is OK as others may have used port number.\nWe now have established a virtual environment for python on a remote system and are serving jupyter notebooks. We now need to access them from the desktop on our local machine. \nStep 7 - Access Jupyter Notebooks being served on the server Now we need to open up another terminal on our machine, one that will be for use in the local environment. The following command is an example of how this can be done.\nssh -N -f -L yyyy:localhost:xxxx jwmurray@ihpc.eng.uts.edu.au # yyyy is the number you will use on your local machine # xxxx is the port used to serve the notebooks remotely  \nStep 8 - Open the notebooks and weave magic If everything has worked to this point you now have jupyter notebooks in a virtual environment being served from the powerful computers of iHPC. We just need to open up a browser and access jupyter from the local desktop. This is done in the usual manner with localhost:yyyy in the browser of your web browser.\nFrom here any work you do in the notebooks will be saved on the remote server in the folder from where you served the notebooks from. \nStep 9 - Terminate the session Consult this link for details on how to terminate the current session.\n","date":1634083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634083200,"objectID":"1eeb2cf8dc4e0e967a67a6776637003b","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/extra/ihpc_guide/","publishdate":"2021-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/extra/ihpc_guide/","section":"extra","summary":"This is a reference guide for accessing the iHPC system for UTS, with a focus on running Python and Jupyter notebooks on iHPC and accessing them from the desktop browser on your local machine. \nSome Helpful References This is the reference for the website for remote access to the HPC at UTS.\nThis is an excellent blog on using Jupyter Notebooks remotely. \nStep 1 - Open the Tunnel to iHPC Navigate to this link and open Student VPN Tunnel.","tags":null,"title":"Running Jupyter notebooks on iHPC","type":"extra"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu"],"categories":["Presentation","Post"],"content":" Recording of the presentation \u0026ldquo;Discovering the Strategies and Promotion Schedules of Coordinated Disinformation via Hawkes Intensity Processes\u0026rdquo; (Tim Graham, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu, Axel Bruns, Dan Angus), presented at the European Communication Conference (ECREA) 2021, 8 Sep. 2021.\nDiscovering the Strategies and Promotion Schedules of Coordinated Disinformation via Hawkes Intensity Processes Tim Graham, Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology\nMarian-Andrei Rizoiu, Data Science Institute, University of Technology Sydney\nAxel Bruns, Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology\nDan Angus, Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology\n‘Fake news’ and broader ‘information disorders’ [6] such as mis- and disinformation have emerged as global issues that threaten to undermine democracy and authentic political communication on social media [1]. Increasingly sophisticated coordination strategies have intensified the scale and scope of the impact that disinformation has on public opinion and democratic trust. Howard et al. [3] found that coordinated disinformation operations are now occurring in 48 countries, and in 2019 the European External Action Service detected and exposed over 1,000 cases of disinformation within the European Union [2]. Whilst disinformation has attracted much scholarly attention, most studies to date have focussed on the diffusion and impact of individual content (e.g. ‘fake news’ articles) and the activity of individual accounts (e.g. bots and trolls).\nAn emerging problem is to understand message coordination strategies, where content authored and distributed by agents (e.g. Twitter trolls) is governed and scheduled by some unknown principal actor [4]. We know that coordinated promotion (e.g. sharing, liking, retweeting) of ‘fake news’ articles by trolls and social bots can greatly increase and amplify the negative effects of these attempts to sow discord and manipulate public conversations about election candidates and partisan issues such as immigration and climate change. Likewise, it is evident that disinformation campaigns unfold via ‘collaborative work’ that co-opts and cultivates organic systems in order to produce desired effects such as increased polarisation, distrust in news media and confusion of the audience [7]. This makes identifying ‘inauthentic’ versus ‘organic’ activity ever more difficult, as they are intricately enmeshed in real-world disinformation campaigns.\nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring the coordinated promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ articles using a novel approach known as Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP; see [5]). We analyse the diffusion of articles from ten major sources of hyperpartisan information and ‘fake news’ within over 16.5 million tweets that linked to content from these sites during July to September 2019. Using HIP, we uncover not only coordination strategies but also the promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ content, where agents (in this case Twitter accounts) are being centrally managed by principals (e.g. state operatives, government officials, etc.) in order to strategically promote ‘fake news’ content and maximise its virality and longevity in the social memory. This paper provides preliminary results from this ongoing research, highlighting the current challenges as well as open problems and gaps for future work.\nReferences [1] Benkler, Y., Faris, R., \u0026amp; Roberts, H.

Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2(CSCW), 183.\nThe panel: \u0026ldquo;Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour in Social Media: New Methods and Findings\u0026rdquo; Panel Rationale Social media platforms are increasingly forced to address what Facebook now describes as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (Gleicher 2018): online influence operations that seek to trick platform algorithms into promoting and recommending ‘problematic information’ (Jack 2017), to mislead the human users of such platforms into accepting and sharing such content, and thereby also to affect broader issue frames and news agendas in mainstream media coverage. Concerns about such coordinated inauthentic behaviour extend earlier fears about the influence of malignant social bots, but also transcend them: drawing on social bots as well as human labour, coordinated inauthentic behaviour is likely to involve a combination of manual and automated activity. This additional human factor also complicates the detection of such coordinated activities, and their distinction from genuine, organic, authentic coordinated actions.\nThis cross-national and interdisciplinary panel approaches the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour from a number of directions. It outlines novel and innovative detection and analysis approaches for a number of leading social media platforms, and presents their results in the context of domestic and international political debates across several national contexts. Further, it also considers how mainstream journalism might report on and respond to such activities in order to protect news audiences from being affected by coordinated inauthentic behaviours.\nThe first two papers in this panel focus especially on coordinated inauthentic link-sharing practices. Paper 1 introduces Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP), a novel technique for inferring the coordinated content promotion schedules of automated social media accounts, and applies this to a major dataset of 16.5 million tweets containing links to ten major sites identified as sources of hyperpartisan content and ‘fake news’. In doing so, it uncovers new networks of inauthentic Twitter actors. Paper 2 investigates similar coordinated link-sharing activity on Facebook in Italy during the 2018 Italian and 2019 European elections. It uncovers evidence for the involvement of dozens of pages, groups, and public profiles in such media manipulation attempts. Paper 3 complements this work by focussing especially on the temporal posting patterns in such coordinated activity. It employs the recurrence plotting technique to identify traces of inauthentic actors’ use of automated scheduling tools in systematically posting content to a network of apparently unrelated pages, focussing here especially on a group of far-right pages on Facebook. Paper 4 examines ten coordinated disinformation campaigns across the globe (e.g., Hong Kong, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany) and identifies important traits that help distinguish between those participating in the disinformation campaign and the regular users they try to imitate. Paper 5, finally, shifts our attention to a core target of such coordinated inauthentic behaviour: the journalists and editors whose perception of current political moods such influence operations often aim to affect. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with Danish news workers and related stakeholders, it examines their understanding of and responses to coordinated mis- and disinformation campaigns.\nCollectively, these studies contribute substantially to advancing the methodological toolkit and extending the empirical evidence base for the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, while also not losing sight of the stakeholders that such work seeks to support. They offer an independent assessment of the nature and extent of the problem across several leading social media platforms, complementing the platform providers’ own investigations into such activities and identifying possible responses to such concerns for both social and mainstream media actors.\nThe papers presented are (presenters bolded):  Discovering the Strategies and Promotion Schedules of Coordinated Disinformation via Hawkes Intensity Processes (Tim Graham, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu, Axel Bruns, Dan Angus) It Takes a Village to Manipulate the Media: Coordinated Link Sharing Behaviour during 2018 and 2019 Italian Elections (Fabio Giglietto, Nicola Righetti, Luca Rossi, Giada Marino) Recurrence Plotting for Detecting Duplicate Online Posting Activities (Dan Angus, Tim Graham, Tobias Keller, Brenda Moon, Axel Bruns) Astroturfing in Hong Kong and Elsewhere: Patterns of Coordination in Hidden Twitter Campaigns (Franziska B.

This document describes these and how to access them. Each resource has its own use scenario, and some may be more adapted to specific problems than others (for example, if you want to set up a Twitter crawler, use a Nectar Virtual Machine for better uptime and to avoid security issues on the compute servers). We have four compute resources and each has attached a storage resource.\nCompute servers and frameworks iHPC servers Link to resource: ihpc.research.uts.edu.au (requires UTS VPN)\nQuick description: iHPC stands for Interactive High-Performance Computing. In a nutshell, these are very large machines (around 60 cores, and terabytes of memory). The machines are hosted in UTS and require both a UTS affiliation and special access. The servers are grouped into clusters, some of which require special access.\nOur group has a private cluster called hephaestos which currently contains three machines (see print screen below). Our private cluster is accessible to BDS members only.\nGetting access: Request an iHPC account (see ihpc.research.uts.edu.au for instructions). Mention the Behavioral Data Science group and Andrei in your request to be automatically added to the hephaestos access lists. Make sure you read the documentation!\nUse case: the iHPC is designed for prototyping that requires large machines (Jupyter Notebook or RStudio), or for intermediary-size compute (for larger size see UTS HPC and NCI). You can use iHPC using its Graphical User Interface (GUI) via NoMachine. You can also connect via console using:\nssh \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@hephaestos1.ihpc.uts.edu.au\nFor use with Jupyter Notebook or RStudio Server, you can redirect ports via SSH tunneling. Assuming the Jupyter Notebook/RStudio Server listens on port 8282, you can redirect that port by connecting to hephaestos1 using:\nssh -L 8282:localhost:8282 \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@hephaestos1.ihpc.uts.edu.au\nafter which you can connect the browser to your local machine to https://localhost:8282 and access the kernel on the distant machines. See here for more details and examples.\nMore details: For detailed instructions on setting up remote Jupyter notebooks on iHPC, check out this guide. \nNeCTAR Virtual Machines Link to resource: https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\nQuick description: NeCTAR is an infrastructure for virtual machines (i.e. machines that can be spawned for a particular purpose), similar to Amazon Web Services. This is quite useful for crawling data with no downtime, hosting visualizers, and even computing. More details here: https://ardc.edu.au/services/nectar-research-cloud/\nOur group has an allocation of 25 instances, 120 vCPUs, and 480 GB of RAM.\nGetting access: First activate your UTS/ANU/Data61 account here: https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/. Then flip Andrei the email address associated with the account, and I'll add you to the project. Note: once you have access, you need to switch projects using the project selector in the top-left corner to access the behavioral-ds allocation.\nUse case: You can easily spawn virtual machines, install stuff on them, play and destroy them. Each virtual machine acts as a computer, therefore you can install web interfaces, use it for compute (the larger flavors), and connect via SSH. The port forwarding trick described for iHPC also works for NeCTAR VMs. \nUTS High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) Link to resource: https://hpc.research.uts.edu.au/\nUsage status: https://hpc.research.uts.edu.au/status/\nQuick description: HPCC is a typical high-performance computing cluster (a.k.a. super-computers), in which jobs run non-interactively. See here a schema of HPC clusters. UTS HPCC uses PBS as the scheduler, and it is designed to be fully compatible with NCI. Its mission is to be a training or development site for larger HPC projects destined for NCI.\nGetting access: You need to request access to the HPCC. Email eResearch-IT@uts.edu.au to introduce yourself and your requirements. Make sure you mention Andrei and that you are part of the Behavioral DS group. Once you have access read the HPC Getting Started pages.\nUse case: As HPC systems stand, UTS HPCC is a small system, but very useful for mid- to largish-scale computations. You can access 600 cores and up to 6TB of memory. Usage-wise, UTS HPCC stands in between iHPC and the NCI. That is, once your compute grows too large for iHPC, you use HPCC to scale it up and prepare your scripts for NCI. \nNational Computation Infrastructure (NCI) supercomputer \u0026ndash; Gadi Link to resource: https://nci.org.au/\nUsage status: https://nci.org.au/our-systems/status\nQuick description: NCI’s Gadi is Australia’s supercomputer. Gadi has 3,200 compute nodes, 155,000 CPU cores, 567 Terabytes of memory, and 640 GPUs (as of 07/09/2021). It has a peak performance of 9 petaflops (by comparison, the largest supercomputer, Fugaku in Japan, has a peak performance of 442 petaflops).\nGadi is a cross-institutional shared resource, and its usage requires credit (in NCI terms service units (SU)). Our group has a varying allocation of SUs to be used for computing, which can be dynamically increased. Speak to Andrei if you believe you may require more than we have or even if you may use up all the exiting allocation (not leaving enough for the others).\nGetting access: You will need to request an NCI account using your UTS/ANU/Data61 email address. Use our project code gh47: Tracking disinformation campaigns across social media (Marian-Andrei Rizoiu) during the joining process. If you already have an account, simply request to join the project. You will subsequently use this project code for all computing. Make sure you have a read of the Gadi User guide.\nUse case: Use Gadi for the largest scale computes, which require years of sequential compute time. Ideally, you designed already your scripts using the UTS HPCC. Note that Gadi is less responsive than HPCC (and less forgiving with not respecting the limits and instructions).\nThere are several queues available for Gadi, depending on your usage requirements. These include normal (day-to-day compute), express (small batches that can be executed fast), hugemem and megamem (large memory requirement), and gpuvolta (for deep learning). \nStorage iHPC data folder (1TB) iHPC home folders are limited to 32 GB. However, each iHPC user has a data folder of 1TB accessible at /data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;. Put here all large files, including your anaconda and datasets. This data folder is on Network File System (NFS) and accessible from any iHPC machine.\niHPC project mount (20TB) For shared files and datasets, our group has a project allocation of 20TB, accessible at /projects/BehavioralDS/. All files in this folder are accessible by all group members.\nNectar storage (12TB) NeCTAR VMs have very little storage space (~30GB of disk). You can also create external volumes that can be attached to the VMs (each 50GB). For larger storage, our group has a 12TB NFS volume that needs to be attached using the following procedure.\n Send the IP address or hostname of the machine that you want to mount the Space storage to Intersect Operations (help@intersect.org.au). Copy Andrei to the email!\n  Install NFS and automount related packages (for Ubuntu):\n  apt-get install nfs-common autofs rpcbind\nsystemctl enable rpcbind\nsystemctl start rpcbind\nsystemctl enable autofs\nsystemctl start autofs\nCreate Directories  mkdir -p /data/mounts\nCreate /etc/auto.data  echo \u0026quot;Q3530 -fstype=nfs,nfsvers=3 10.255.122.28:/gpfs/general00/pool9000/Q3530/Q3530\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/auto.data\nModify /etc/auto.master  Run the following command to insert mount point to /etc/auto.master file\necho \u0026quot;/data/mounts /etc/auto.data\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/auto.master\nRestart autofs and create symlink  Restart autofs service to apply the above changes\nsystemctl restart autofs\nln -s /data/mounts/Q3530 /data/Q3530 \nNCI storage (4TB) Our group has a storage allocation of 4TB on NCI. It can be accessed at /g/data/gh47/. If you want to use this allocation in your PBS jobs, you need to explicitly ask for it in the submission script. For example, to indicate that credit should be used from gh47 and to access both the scratch and the /g/data allocation, one would add the following lines in the submission script:\n#PBS -P gh47\n#PBS -l storage=scratch/gh47+g/data/gh47\n","date":1632441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632441600,"objectID":"8e8ab4769ab938b9c2d74e60b2dee5af","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/extra/compute_resources/","publishdate":"2021-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/extra/compute_resources/","section":"extra","summary":"Our group has access to considerable computation and storage resources.

This page will help you get started by providing useful information on how to get set up and ready to roll. If you’re new not only to BDS but to UTS as a whole, see the bottom of this page for some additional useful pointers. \nCompute resources As a very first step, carefully read this introduction to our computing and storage resources: iHPC, UTS HPCC, Nectar, and NCI. It will tell you everything that’s necessary to get cracking and crunching with that exciting data! \n\nCommunication Group’s webpage Our group’s webpage is https://www.behavioral-ds.science/. It lists the members, our news, our publications, and blog entries. We also use it to keep track of our reading group schedule. Our website is collaborative, and every member needs to update it (for example to add their personal profile, or to fill in the reading details). The webpage is hosted on Github pages, and we update it by committing to the repository.\nTo add your profile to the lab's people page, you need to fork the lab's repository on GitHub, edit it is to add your profile, and create a pull request. More instructions are in the repository’s README. \nSlack Join the BDS team on Slack by asking Andrei to send you an invite. We use Slack for all communications. The group’s philosophy is that we all are aware of the work of others, and we pitch in when we feel like it. The workspace is organized in public channels, one for each project.\nEach BDS member is part of the channels they work on (usually one project). All research-oriented discussions go in the project channel (please keep the DM for only admin and personal issues). Feel free to roam around and peek at any public channel.\nThere are several public channels that you might want to peak at:\n #general \u0026ndash; general announcements, usually admin- and social group-related #o-data \u0026ndash; datasets #compute-power \u0026ndash; computation resources and issues #reading \u0026ndash; what to read, and announcements about the reading group #random \u0026ndash; non-work banter and water cooler conversation   Meetings Here is some good advice on how to make meetings with your advisor as effective and successful as possible. Please read it.\nWhere possible, in-person (offline) meetings are preferred. For online and mixed-mode meetings we use Zoom. When online, we will use Zoom’s Shared Whiteboard to take collective notes. If you have a Zoom-compatible tablet with a pen, it is recommended to install Zoom as drawing with a pen is considerably easier than with a mouse. Alternative environments (like Miro or Google Jamboard) can also be used. \nReading group We have a reading group that runs for one hour each week. The meeting runs mixed-mode, on Zoom and in-person in Sydney. During the meeting, we read papers and run group-oriented activities (such as three-minute thesis presentations and conference dry-runs). The meeting is run each week by a different member (see the online roster). When it is your turn, you can populate the meeting details as described above (see group’s webpage). \nDocumenting your research Keeping notes It is important that you keep thorough notes of your research. This will make it easier to remember the things you’ve done, the things you still need to do, important references you’ve come across, etc. It will also let you share your thoughts with the rest of the group, and it will make you a better, more disciplined researcher.\nWe recommend two ways of keeping notes, you will need to choose one. The first is a rolling dated Overleaf document, where each week is a section and under which you note your work and progress, including figures and interpretations. Keep the most recent on top (i.e. you add at the beginning of the document, not at the end). The second way is the app Notion, which has free academic plans with your UTS student number email address. Create a master page that you will share with Andrei. On the Master page link your reading list, meeting notes etc. (see an example print-screen). Note that we suggest using a dedicated tool for managing your reading and related work (such as Mendeley or Zotero).\nWriting papers You can find some tips and tools for writing papers in LaTeX on dlab’s tips for writing. \nBlog posts Blog posts are a great way of publicizing your research results beyond good old (and slooow…) papers. They are also a channel for making what you’re doing accessible to the general public, rather than just to other academics.\nTherefore, every paper published at BDS is expected to be accompanied by a blog post that is written in non-technical terms and easily accessible to non-experts, to be published on BDS’s research page. You will need to select a category or shout if none is adequate. \nNew to UTS? The following pointers might help you get started if you’ve just arrived at UTS. \nWifi On campus, the best wireless network to use is UTS-Wifi. You can use it with your UTS student username and password. For Linux, check the below screen for configuration.\nVPN To access UTS resources, such as the iHPC compute servers, from outside of the UTS network, you need to use the UTS VPN. \nUTS student/staff card During your first days at UTS, you’ll get your UTS student card, which will serve to access the library and the UTS buildings. Once you have the card, you need to finalize your Safety and Wellbeing Essentials (via Rapid Global, use login.uts.edu.au to access this application) after which you will automatically get access to DSI HDR dedicated spaces (room CB02.11.141) and all the space of DSI (Bulding 2, levels 11 and 12) and School of Computer Science (Building 11, levels 6 and 7).\n\nUTS Honorary appointments Group members who are not UTS staff nor students need to obtain honorary UTS appointments. An honorary staff has a UTS online account and can access internal systems, including the compute resources (note: not all compute resources require a UTS affiliation, check details above).\nTo get an Honorary appointment, Andrei needs to initiate the process with UTS admins, after which you will receive email instructions by email. Please make sure you fill in the online form ASAP, as the downstream admin process can take weeks. UTS Honorary members are considered staff in UTS systems.\n","date":1632441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632441600,"objectID":"61cfbf47d93ad57ea59cbbf75b9650c4","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/extra/onboarding/","publishdate":"2021-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/extra/onboarding/","section":"extra","summary":"(this document is shamelessly adapted from Robert West’s excellent dlab onboarding page)\nIf you’re new to the Behavioral Data Science lab (BDS), first of all: welcome!

Therefore, identifying viable and desirable job transition pathways for individuals has been a growing area of interest. The current state of the art methods [Moro, Frank et al, Nat.Comm.’21] [Dawson et al, PLOS ONE ‘21] take a global view to estimate the dynamics of labour markets using factors such as skill similarity, location, education, experience, and industry labour flows. While these have been shown as important features for explaining job transition pathways, they implicitly assume that the changes in the occupation of an individual depend solely on their current occupation. Other works [Kern et al, PNAS’19] have shown that worker psychometric profiles (measured using Big5 feature) closely relate to their occupations. In other words, people have predispositions towards certain occupations. This project aims to build personalised recommender systems for occupation transitions that account for worker personality, previous experience and education. \nThe Opportunity The Behavioral Data Science lab at UTS has several openings for PhD students to research the Future of Work and labour market networks. The topics of interest are job transitions, skills analysis, and the impacts of technology on labour markets. However, we’re open to other related areas, such as impacts of personality profiles on job choice, quantifying cultural differences between labour markets, and competitive dynamics of occupations and industries. The research will apply data science and machine learning techniques to labour market data, such as job ads and employment statistics. \nWhat We Offer This project is part of a wider collaboration with US-based universities and companies. This can open unique opportunities to research internships in both overseas academia and industry. Furthermore, you will be supported throughout your doctorate to become a first rate researcher. This will include:\n access to rich datasets to derive insights and real-world problems and know-how; exposure to industry networks to apply your work, and possible career paths upon graduation; collaboration with top international universities from our networks; and a supportive peer-group of doctoral researchers with regular events and reading groups. weekly meetings with supervisors to advance your research;  Once you graduate, you will have developed in-demand skills, published peer-review papers, broadened your professional network, and established yourself as an expert in the Future of Work. \nAbout You To be successful in this role, you will either have:\n a strong background in data science and applied machine learning; an interest labour markets; knowledge of at least one programming language, such as Python and R;  AND/OR\n A strong background in economics and are willing to develop your technical skills;  You will also likely have an Honours or Masters degree. However, equivalent experience coupled with a relevant Bachelor’s Degree could also be sufficient.\nMost importantly, you will show a great deal of initiative, thrive under autonomy, and have a passion for applying rigorous research to help people understand real problems. \nFunding Scholarships are available but will be awarded through a competitive process. Stipend top-ups and paid research work might be available throughout your thesis. \nHow to Apply If you are interested, please send your CV and a cover letter to Marian-Andrei.Rizoiu@uts.edu.au. The cover letter should detail your academic track record, why you are interested in this topic and why you are a good match for the subject. \nReferences [Moro et al, Nat.Comm.’21] Moro, E., Frank, M.

McCarthy, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu"],"categories":["Research","Post"],"content":"The online world is continuously expanding — always aggregating more services, more users and more activity. Last year, the number of websites registered on the \u0026ldquo;.com\u0026rdquo; domain surpassed 150,000,000.\nHowever, more than a quarter of a century since its first commercial use, the growth of the online world is now slowing down in some key categories.\nWe conducted a multi-year research project analysing global trends in online diversity and dominance. Our research, published in Public Library of Science, is the first to reveal some long-term trends in how businesses compete in the age of the web.\nWe saw a dramatic consolidation of attention towards a shrinking (but increasingly dominant) group of online organisations. So, while there is still growth in the functions, features and applications offered on the web, the number of entities providing these functions is shrinking.\nWeb diversity nosedives We analysed more than six billion user comments from the social media website Reddit dating back to 2006, as well as 11.8 billion Twitter posts from as far back as 2011. In total, our research used a massive 5.6Tb trove of data from more than a decade of global activity.\nThis dataset was more than four times the size of the original data from the Hubble Space Telescope, which helped Brian Schmidt and colleagues do their Nobel-prize winning work in 1998 to prove the universe's expansion is accelerating.\nWith the Reddit posts, we analysed all the links to other sites and online services — more than one billion in total — to understand the dynamics of link growth, dominance and diversity through the decade.\nWe used a measure of link \u0026ldquo;uniqueness\u0026rdquo;. On this scale, 1 represents maximum diversity (all links have their own domain) and 0 is minimum diversity (all links are on one domain, such as \u0026ldquo;youtube.com\u0026rdquo;).\nA decade ago, there was a much greater variety of domains within links posted by users of Reddit, with more than 20 different domains for every 100 random links users posted. Now there are only about five different domains for every 100 links posted.\nIn fact, between 60-70% of all attention on key social media platforms is focused towards just ten popular domains.\nBeyond social media platforms, we also studied linkage patterns across the web, looking at almost 20 billion links over three years. These results reinforced the \u0026ldquo;rich are getting richer\u0026rdquo; online.\nThe authority, influence and visibility of the top 1,000 global websites (as measured by network centrality or PageRank) is growing every month, at the expense of all other sites.\nApp diversity is on the rise The web started as a source of innovation, new ideas and inspiration — a technology that opened up the playing field. It's now also becoming a medium that actually stifles competition and promotes monopolies and the dominance of a few players.\nOur findings resolve a long-running paradox about the nature of the web: does it help grow businesses, jobs and investment? Or does it make it harder to get ahead by letting anyone and everyone join the game? The answer, it turns out, is it does both.\nWhile the diversity of sources is in decline, there is a countervailing force of continually increasing functionality with new services, products and applications — such as music streaming services (Spotify), file sharing programs (Dropbox) and messaging platforms (Messenger, Whatsapp and Snapchat).\nWebsite ‘infant mortality\u0026rsquo; Another major finding was the dramatic increase in the \u0026ldquo;infant mortality\u0026rdquo; rate of websites — with the big kids on the block guarding their turf more staunchly than ever.\nWe examined new domains that were continually referenced or linked-to in social media after their first appearance. We found that while almost 40% of the domains created 2006 were active five years on, only a little more than 3% of those created in 2015 remain active today.\nThe dynamics of online competition are becoming clearer and clearer. And the loss of diversity is concerning. Unlike the natural world, there are no sanctuaries; competition is part of both nature and business.\nOur study has profound implications for business leaders, investors and governments everywhere. It shows the network effects of the web don't just apply to online businesses. They have permeated the entire economy and are rewriting many previously accepted rules of economics.\nFor example, the idea that businesses can maintain a competitive advantage based on where they are physically located is increasingly tenuous. Meanwhile, there's new opportunities for companies to set up shop from anywhere in the world and serve a global customer base that's both mainstream and niche.\nThe best way to encourage diversity is to have more global online businesses focused on providing diverse services, by addressing consumers\u0026rsquo; increasingly niche needs.\nIn Australia, we're starting to see this through homegrown companies such as Canva, SafetyCulture and iWonder. Hopefully many more will appear in the decade ahead.\nThis article was first published by the authors on The Conversation.\n","date":1625184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625184000,"objectID":"5403cd8a8010a78a17fdce661d172816","permalink":"https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme1_content/online_diversity/","publishdate":"2021-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/theme1_content/online_diversity/","section":"theme1_content","summary":"More than a quarter of a century since the first commercial use of the online world, its growth is now slowing down in some key categories.","tags":null,"title":"We spent six years scouring billions of links, and found the web is both expanding and shrinking ","type":"theme1_content"},{"authors":["Rohit Ram"],"categories":["Software","Post"],"content":" -- Solution -- Social media platforms, although relatively new, host millions of users and billions of interactions daily. As tied as we are to these platforms, they profoundly impact our social institutions through phenomena such as disinformation, political polarization, and social bots.\nResearchers are increasingly interested in trying to form an understanding of phenomena and their implications. Social scientists, political scientists, and data practitioners alike curate expansive datasets to combat these potentially adverse effects on our society; however, they lack the appropriate tooling.\nbirdspotter is an easy-to-use tool that models Twitter users\u0026rsquo; attributes and labels them. It comes prepackaged with a state-of-the-art bot detector and an influence quantification system based on tweet dynamics. birdspotter features a generalized user labeler, which can be retrained easily with the engineered features to address a variety of use cases. Also, birdspotter.ml is a web application that can be utilized to explore datasets and derive a narrative around a dataset.\nIn this post, I'll showcase the basic usage of birdspotter and birdspotter.ml.\nInstallation The package can be installed in the canonical python way:\npip install birdspotter  Getting a dataset The Twitter T\u0026amp;Cs restrict the sharing of tweet data directly online; however, they do allow the sharing of tweet-ids, which can be converted to full tweet data through a process called hydration. Tools like twarc can be used to hydrate a Tweet ID dataset. The resulting dataset will be in jsonl (line delimited json) format, which birdspotter accepts directly.\nIn the below examples, we use two datasets; a collection of COVID-19 related tweets from January 31st, 2020 [1], and a collection of tweets about politicians on Twitter [2].\nThe politicians\u0026rsquo; dataset was acquired through the following process (and a similar process was taken for the COVID-19 dataset):\npip install twarc wget http://twitterpoliticians.org./downloads/base/all_tweet_ids.csv twarc hydrate all_tweet_ids.csv \u0026gt; tweets.jsonl  Basic Usage The code below imports the main class Birdspotter, extracts the tweets from their standard format, labels the users with the default bot detector and influence, and reformats the retweet cascades into a tidier format.\n## Import birdspotter from birdspotter import BirdSpotter ## Extracts the tweets from the raw jsonl [https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs] bs = BirdSpotter('covid19.jsonl') ## Uses the default bot labeller and influence quantification systems bs.getLabeledUsers() ## Formats the retweet cascades, such that expected retweet structures can extracted bs.getCascadesDataFrame() ## Access the botness labels and influence scores bs.featureDataframe[['botness', 'influence']]  From here, the dataset is readily profile-able:\nbotness_dist = sns.histplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=\u0026quot;botness\u0026quot;) influence_eccdf = sns.ecdfplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=\u0026quot;influence\u0026quot;, complementary=True).set(xscale=\u0026quot;log\u0026quot;, yscale=\u0026quot;log\u0026quot;)  The visualizer An alternative way to profile a dataset is the use birdspotter.ml, which facilitates dataset exploration and narrative construction.\nThe visualizer features a scatterplot (on the left) of influence and botness for a sample of users and the population density. The colors represent the hashtags (a proxy for the topic) that the users most tweet about in the dataset. Users within the scatterplot are hoverable and selectable, and their information populates in the components on the right.\nThe top right component shows information and metrics about the selected user and links the user's profile.\nThe bottom right component shows the retweet cascades where a user has participated and highlights their participation. The points represent the follower counts (social capital) of users and their retweets/tweets\u0026rsquo; timing. The points are also hoverable and selectable.\nCustomising the labeller By default, the labeler is trained as a bot detection system, comparable to the state-of-the-art botometer. Notable, birdspotter is provided in an offline package and can be applied at scale, while botometer is accessible only via an online API, which is often prohibitively rate-limited.\nbirdspotter is a versatile tool and can be utilized by practitioners for a variety of use-cases. For example, we could train the labeler to identify political leaning. This process is a bit involved, so we summarise it below;\n We hydrate some tweets from the Twitter Parlimentarian Database We filter the tweets to include only Australian Politicians. We label right-wing partied politicians positively, and others negatively (with bs_pol.getBotAnnotationTemplate for example) We retrain birdspotter with these new labels and label all users (i.e., including users the politicians retweeted) using the new model  bs_pol = BirdSpotter('aus_tweets.jsonl') bs_pol.trainClassifierModel('pol_training_data.pickle') bs_pol.getLabeledUsers()  On this limited of Australian politicians dataset, a 10-fold CV of birdspotter garners an average AUC (Area under ROC) of 0.986.\nConclusion birdspotter aims to democratize social analyzes that were once the domain of machine learning experts, generating insights and understanding of online phenomena and mitigating their potentially adverse effects on our society. This post shows how birdspotter can be used in both a simple and advanced way to recover such insights.\nReferences [1] Chen, E. et al. 2020.

We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs. The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles and real-time job ads. We also build a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends. For full technical details, please read the pre-print.  People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.\nIn our latest research, Nik Dawson and Marian-Andrei Rizoiu (together with collaborator Mary-Anne Williams) and I developed a novel method to measure the \u0026lsquo;distance\u0026rsquo; between sets of skills using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn't to say that it's not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.\nThe SKILL SPACE Method Distance between skills\nIn order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage\u0026rsquo; (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.\nHere, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python\u0026rsquo; and ‘C++\u0026rsquo;. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development\u0026rsquo; and ‘Healthcare\u0026rsquo;) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge\u0026rsquo; to specialist skills.\nDistance between occupations\nNext, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between sets of skills. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.\nEach occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by Frey and Osborne - dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker\u0026rsquo; is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker\u0026rsquo; are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer\u0026rsquo;, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer\u0026rsquo; represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker\u0026rsquo; that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.\nConstructing a Job Transitions Recommender System The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that job transitions are asymmetric - it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.\nWe account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the pre-print for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual\u0026rsquo; (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset - described as the transition probability between a ‘source\u0026rsquo; and a ‘target\u0026rsquo; occupation. This creates the Transitions Map, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.\nThe coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source\u0026rsquo; occupations are in columns and ‘targets\u0026rsquo; are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager\u0026rsquo; has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk\u0026rsquo; than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas\u0026rsquo;) than others (‘Life Scientists\u0026rsquo;). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.\nOur model achieves high levels of performance, accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions.\nRecommending Jobs and Skills The Transitions Map provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations. We call this the Job Transitions Recommender System. In the figure below, we highlight the example of `Domestic Cleaners\u0026rsquo;, an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.\nFirst, we use the Transitions Map to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners\u0026rsquo; all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential\u0026rsquo; services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers\u0026rsquo;, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favorable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers\u0026rsquo; as the target occupation for this example.\nSkill recommendations for target occupations\nWe then take the Job Transitions Recommender System a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the skill is important to the target occupation and (2) the distance to acquire the skill is large (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner\u0026rsquo; in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer\u0026rsquo; occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance\u0026rsquo;. Conversely, the reasons not to develop a skill are when (1) the skill is not important or (2) the distance is small to the target occupation. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer\u0026rsquo; jobs require ‘Business Analysis\u0026rsquo; and ‘Finance\u0026rsquo; skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer\u0026rsquo; occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing\u0026rsquo; and ‘Laundry\u0026rsquo; are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer\u0026rsquo; jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner\u0026rsquo; already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.\nDeveloping a Leading Indicator of AI Adoption The SKILL SPACE method can also be flexibly applied to other adjacent problems, such as identifying the extent of specific skill gaps of firms within industries and potential adoption of new technologies. Here, we develop a leading indicator for emerging technology adoption and potential labour market disruptions based on skills data, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example. We select AI because of its potential impacts on transforming labour tasks and accelerating job transitions. By applying SKILL SPACE, we were able to measure the yearly similarities between an adaptive set of AI skills against each of the 19 Australian industries from 2013-2019 (see the pre-print for technical details). As industry skill sets become more similar to AI skills, the skills gap is diminished and firms within industries are more likely to possess the skills to make productive use of AI technologies. The growth of AI skill similarity within industries is shown by the coloured areas of the radar chart below.\nAll industries have increased their similarity levels to AI skills. This highlights the growing importance of AI skills across the Australian labour market. However, the rates of similarity are unequally distributed. Some industries, such as ‘Finance and Insurance Services\u0026rsquo; and ‘Information Media and Telecommunications\u0026rsquo; command much higher rates of AI skill similarity. This indicates that not only are firms within these industries increasingly demanding AI skills but also that the AI skills gaps within these industries are much smaller. Therefore, it is likely that firms within these industries are adopting AI and making productive use of these technologies.\nAlso noteworthy are the differences in growth rates toward AI skill similarity. As the figure above clearly shows, AI skill similarity has rapidly grown for some industries and more modestly for others. For instance, ‘Retail Trade\u0026rsquo; has experienced the highest levels of growth in similarity to AI skills, increasing by 407% from 2013 to 2019. The majority of this growth has occurred recently, which coincides with the launch of Amazon Australia in 2017. Since then, Amazon has swiftly hired thousands in Australia. This indicator can assist policy-makers and businesses to robustly monitor the growth of AI skills (or other emerging technologies), which acts as a proxy for AI adoption within industries.\nConclusion While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises, and other factors will continue to shift labour demands causing workers to move between jobs. If labour transitions occur efficiently, significant productivity and equity benefits arise at all levels of the labour market; if transitions are slow, or fail, significant costs are borne to both the State and the individual. Therefore, it's in the interests of workers, firms, and governments that labour transitions are efficient and effective. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.\nFor the full technical details, please read the pre-print.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Bledi Taska and Davor Miskulin from Burning Glass Technologies for generously providing the job advertisements data for this research and for their valuable feedback.

To overcome this hurdle, the researchers’ best practice in experimental design is the randomized controlled trial. However, there are only specific experiments that we can perform. For example, to test the whether smoking causes cancer, we can’t force subjects to smoke. ⊕In the 1950s the tobacco companies argued that there could be some confounding factor (a gene) which smokers and lung cancer patients shared. In general, restricting ourselves to experimental studies to determine causation is incredibly limiting (especially for data scientists). We want to make the same causal conclusions from observational studies and those from experimental studies. We can do that by studying causal inference.\nSimpson’s Paradox An example of the importance of understanding causal relationships is given by Simpson’s Paradox (Simpson 1951), which describes a peculiar phenomenon that can present in data sets, where a correlation between two variables is present in one direction but reverses in each stratum of the data. The paradox expressed best through an example: ⊕This appears to suggest that the more someone exercises, the higher their cholesterol is! This is absurd!  Figure 1: The results of an experiment, where x-axis represents how much exercise an individual does in hours, and y-axis represents cholestral measurment for the same individual.  Figure 1 shows a positive correlation in an experiment that measures individuals’ exercise per week and cholesterol. At first glance, this seems absurd, but when we partition the data by another causal variable, this seems reasonable:  Figure 2: The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age  ⊕(Also note, we have fabricated the data, although these relationships are quite plausible) Understanding the full causal story is essential. Without an entire causal narrative, we might recommend inappropriate interventions; for example, a doctor might prescribe less exercise to reduce cholesterol in the case above.\nTo deduce such causal stories, we need to apply the methodology of causal inference.\n Structural Equation Models and Causal Graphs A structural equation model (SEM) is a set of equations representing the relationship between variables. For example, the equations which generated the data from the Simpson’s paradox example, are given as: \\[ \\begin{align*} age \u0026amp;= U_1 \\\\ exercise \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{13}*age + U_2 \\\\ cholesteral \u0026amp;= -4*exercise + age + U_3 \\end{align*} \\] We can think of \\(U_1\\), \\(U_2\\), and \\(U_3\\) as specific unobserved exogenous variables of an individual, which generate their endogenous variables (something like error terms).\nA causal graph is a DAG which describes the existence of relationships between variables in a model. An edge x -\u0026gt; y represents the relationship x directly causes y. Consequently, causal graphs can represent SEMs: Indeed this graph shows how age confounds the effect of exercise on cholesterol.\n Do-calculus Pearl (1995) outline a method to remove this confounding (and other similar scenarios) using do-calculus. Outlining the specifics of do-calculus is beyond the scope of this blog post (but for interested readers, we suggest (Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016)). In brief, do-calculus introduces the \\(do()\\) operator, which acts as an intervention and fixes a variable to a particular constant. For example, consider a similar binary situation to the Simpson’s paradox example, where exer is a binary variable true if the individual is active, chol is a binary variable true if the individual has high cholesterol, and age is a binary variable true if the individual is over 60.\nbin_simpsons_data \u0026lt;- simpsons_data %\u0026gt;% mutate(age = age \u0026gt; 60) %\u0026gt;% # Binarize the age, so those over 60 are True, and under 60 are False mutate(exer = exercise\u0026gt;mean(exercise)) %\u0026gt;% # Binarize the exercise level, so those above the average are True, and under are False mutate(chol = cholesteral\u0026gt;mean(cholesteral)) # Binarize the cholesteral level, so those above the average are True, and under are False We ask the same experimental question; does exercise reduce cholesterol. A naive approach would be to compute the effect as \\(P(chol | exer = 1) - P(chol | exer = 0)=\\) 0.168, where \\(P(chol | exer)\\) is computed by filtering the data according to exer. Taking this approach, we would erroneously observe that the effect was positive since those who exercise more are also old and more likely to have high cholesterol.\nThe experimental best practice approach would be to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A random selection of individuals are assigned to do a high exercise regiment and the others do a low exercise regiment (regardless of age). The RCT implicitly removes the natural tendency of exercise to vary with age and allows researchers to observe the causal effect of exercise on cholesterol. When using data generated in such a fashion, increases/decreases in the probability of having high cholesterol caused by exercise are given by \\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 1) - P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 0)\\). This metric is known as the Average Causal Effect (ACE), sometimes called the Average Treatment Effect. Note that by conditioning on \\(exer=x\\), with data generated by an RCT, researchers are essentially limiting the data used to estimate \\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\\), to individuals who were forced to do an exercise regiment \\(x\\). The do here represents forcing individuals to take an intervention value, regardless of their natural tendency, and this is captured by the \\(do()\\) operator. In this case, \\(P(chol | do(exer = x)) = P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\\), since the data was generated with an RCT. However, RCTs can be prohibitively expensive (both in time and money) and might not be necessary to tease out a causal effect.\nWe would still like to estimate the ACE, \\(P(chol | do(exer = 1)) - P(chol | do(exer = 0))\\), by using data that wasn’t generated from an RCT. By using the \\(do()\\) operator here, we aim to disassociate exer from its natural tendency with age and effectively perform a graph surgery:\nPearl, Glymour, and Jewell (2016) provide an adjustment formula for just this scenario: \\[ P(y|do(x)) = \\sum_z \\frac{P(X=x, Y=y, PA=z)}{P(X=x| PA=z)} \\] where \\(X\\) represents the variable we are acting on, \\(Y\\) the variable we measure results from, and \\(PA\\) the parents of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) or more generally any nodes that satisfy the back-door criterion (which we will introduce later). Note this allows us to derive the causal effect, as if we had generated data with an RCT, using only probabilities estimated from data not generated by an RCT.\nAs such we compute our ACE for the binary scenario:\n# The Joint Distribution P(age, exer, chol) i.e. P(x,y,z) p_aec \u0026lt;- bin_simpsons_data %\u0026gt;% count(age, exer, chol) %\u0026gt;% mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) # The Marginal Distribution P(age) i.e. P(z) p_a \u0026lt;- bin_simpsons_data %\u0026gt;% count(age) %\u0026gt;% mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) # The Marginal Distribution P(age, exer) i.e. P(x, z) p_ea \u0026lt;- bin_simpsons_data %\u0026gt;% count(age, exer) %\u0026gt;% mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) # The Conditional Mariginal Distribution P(exer | age) i.e. P(x | z) p_e_a \u0026lt;- p_a %\u0026gt;% right_join(p_ea, by=\u0026quot;age\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(freq = freq.y/freq.x) %\u0026gt;% select(age, exer, freq) # The Intervention Distribution P(chol | do(exer)) i.e. P(y | do(x)) probabilities \u0026lt;- data.table(p_aec %\u0026gt;% left_join(p_e_a, by=c(\u0026quot;age\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;exer\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(freq = freq.x/freq.y) %\u0026gt;% select(age, exer, chol, freq) %\u0026gt;% filter(chol) # We are only concerned with what cause high cholestral ) # The average causal effect of exer on chol ACE \u0026lt;- sum(probabilities[exer==T, freq]) - sum(probabilities[exer==F, freq])  This procedure leads to a negative ACE of -0.175, which shows the causal effect of going from high to low exercise on the probability of getting high cholesterol.\nA natural question that follows from this example is, under what conditions can we use such adjustments to achieve an identifiable causal effect.\n d-seperation To understand common scenarios where the effect of variable \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is identifiable within a causal graph, we must first introduce the concept of d-separation, also known as blocking. A pair of variable \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are said to be blocked if they are conditionally independent, given a set of nodes \\(Z\\). There are three graph types, which are essential for blocking:\nIn the chain scenario, \\(X \\sim Y\\) is blocked by conditioning on \\(Z={M}\\). This is sometimes refered to as the mediation scenario, which we will address further in the front-door criterion.\nIn the fork scenario, \\(X \\sim Y\\) is blocked by conditioning on \\(Z={Z}\\). This is sometimes refered to as the confounder scenario, which is the situation in the simpson’s paradox example.\nFinally, in the collider scenario, \\(X \\sim Y\\) is blocked by not conditioning on \\(Z={M}\\). The idea that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which are independent, to begin with, can become conditionally dependant is unintuitive. One way to think about this is that we are sharing information received from $ Y $ with $ X $ through $ M $ when we condition on $ M $. For a more thorough investigation into this phenomenon, refer to (Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016).\nA path is said to be blocked by \\(Z\\) if it contains a chain or fork with its middle node in \\(Z\\) or a collider with its middle node not in \\(Z\\).\nWe are now ready to introduce the main criteria for which we can perform adjustments.\n The Backdoor Definition 1 (The Backdoor Criterion) A set of nodes \\(Z\\), given a DAG \\(G\\) and a pair of nodes \\((X,Y)\\), is said to satisfy the backdoor criterion if no node in \\(Z\\) is a descendant of \\(X\\), and \\(Z\\) blocks all paths between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which contain arrows into \\(X\\).  If there exists are set of nodes why satisfy the backdoor criterion, then the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is identifiable and given by: \\[ P(y|do(x)) = \\sum_z \\frac{P(X=x, Y=y, Z=z)}{P(X=x| Z=z)} \\]\nThe backdoor criterion stops undue influence through the backdoor paths; it leaves direct paths between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and it blocks spurious paths.\nIt is clear that { age } satisfies these conditions to be a backdoor adjustment set in the example above.\n The Front-door There are notably common scenarios where this doesn’t work. For example, consider a constructed causal mediation situation, as follows: In this case we cannot use the backdoor criterion, to detect the effect of smoking on cancer because tar is a descendant of smoking, and there exists no direct link between smoking and cancer. We must use instead the frontdoor criterion:\nDefinition 2 (The Frontdoor Criterion) A set of nodes \\(Z\\), given a DAG \\(G\\) and a pair of nodes \\((X,Y)\\), is said to satisfy the frontdoor criterion if; \\(Z\\) intercepts all direct paths from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), all paths between \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) are blocked, and all backdoor paths between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are blocked by \\(X\\).  If there exists are set of nodes \\(Z\\) which satisfy the frontdoor criterion, and \\(P(x, z)\u0026gt;0\\), then the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is identifiable and given by: \\[ P(y|do(x)) = \\sum_z P(z|x) \\sum_{x^\\prime} P(y|x^\\prime, z)P(x^\\prime) \\] In our smoking scenario, we see that by adjusting for tar , we can observe the effect of smoking on cancer.\n Conclusion The above briefly outlines a core motivation for studying causal inference and causal stories. We summarise some of the underlying theory of causal inference and show practical methodology through the frontdoor and backdoor criterion for determining causal effects through entirely observational studies.\nThere are notable aspects of causal inference we have omitted from this taster. The most gaping is the lack of an explanation for the powerful tool of counterfactuals. We have only presented binary examples here (aside from our motivating example); however, perhaps the most common and useful causal inference application is to continuous examples using regression with linear models. Ultimately, we decided this was beyond causal inference taster’s scope and were more deserving of their own articles.

In the context of retweet diffusion cascades, the first row is the original tweet and all following events are its retweets. time records the relative time (in second) of each retweet to the original tweet and magnitude is the follows’ count of the user who retweeted.\nFitting a model on data We can then fit on the cascades simulated in the previous section. After providing the data and model_type, the fitting procedure will spawn 10 AMPL optimization procedures with different parameter inistializations due to the non-convexity of some likelihood functions. Among the 10 fitted model, the one giving the best likelihood value will be returned. To make the fitting procedure faster, we can specify the number of cores to be used for fitting them in parallel.\nfitted_model \u0026lt;- fit_series(data, model_type = 'EXP', observation_time = 5, cores = 10) fitted_model  ## Model: EXP ## No. of cascades: 100 ## init_par ## K 7.92e+00; theta 1.32e+00 ## par ## K 8.51e-01; theta 1.06e+00 ## Neg Log Likelihood: 285.488 ## lower_bound ## K 1.00e-100; theta 1.00e-100 ## upper_bound ## K 1.00e+04; theta 3.00e+02 ## convergence: 0  Available models There are 8 models available so far in this package:\n   Model Abbreviation (model_type) Intensity Function Parameters     Hawkes process with an exponential kernel function EXP  K,theta   Hawkes process with a power-law kernel function PL  K,c,theta   HawkesN process with an exponential kernel function EXPN  K,theta,N   HawkesN process with a power-law kernel function PLN  K,c,theta,N   Marked Hawkes process with an exponential kernel function mEXP  K,beta,theta   Marked Hawkes process with a power-law kernel function mPL  K,beta,c,theta   Marked HawkesN process with an exponential kernel function mEXPN  K,beta,theta,N   Marked HawkesN process with a power-law kernel function mPLN  K,beta,c,theta,N    Acknowledgement The development of this package is supported by the Green Policy grant from the National Security College, Crawford School, ANU.\nLicense Both dataset and code are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.
