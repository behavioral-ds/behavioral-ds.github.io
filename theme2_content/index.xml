&lt;p>On October 28, 2017, an anonymous 4chan user made a cryptic post claiming Hillary Clinton would be arrested within days. Four years later, on January 6, 2021, devotees of the QAnon conspiracy theory - which originated from that very post - stormed the U.S. Capitol in an act that left five people dead and over 140 police officers injured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tragic event underscores a critical question:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What if we could have seen this coming?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we're introducing IC-Mamba, a state-of-the-art model that can forecast social media engagement patterns and detect viral misinformation before it spirals out of control. By modeling the complex temporal dynamics of how content spreads online, IC-Mamba achieves unprecedented accuracy in predicting which posts will go viral - often within just 15-30 minutes of publication.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-challenge-understanding-intervalcensored-social-media-data">The Challenge: Understanding Interval-Censored Social Media Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Social media platforms don't provide continuous streams of engagement data. Instead, they offer snapshots at irregular intervals - what we call &amp;ldquo;interval-censored&amp;rdquo; data. As illustrated in Figure 1, while users interact with content continuously, platforms only report cumulative counts at discrete observation points.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="./featured.png" width="100%">
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. Illustration of interval-censored social media engagement data. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This creates unique challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Irregular sampling&lt;/strong>: Observation intervals vary from minutes to hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cumulative counts&lt;/strong>: We only see totals, not individual actions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multi-scale dynamics&lt;/strong>: Engagement patterns evolve from rapid initial spread to long-term influence&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="icmamba-a-novel-architecture-for-early-detection">IC-Mamba: A Novel Architecture for Early Detection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba combines three key components to tackle these challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="1-timeaware-positional-embeddings">1. Time-Aware Positional Embeddings&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We developed a dual encoding strategy that captures both relative and absolute temporal relationships:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE)&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>RTE(t, t_ref) = sin((t - t_ref) / σ)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Absolute Temporal Encoding (ATE)&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>ATE(t) = [sin(t/10000^(2i/d)), cos(t/10000^(2i/d))]&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These embeddings are then modulated by observed engagement levels, allowing the model to learn characteristic temporal patterns associated with different levels of social impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="2-intervalcensored-state-space-modeling">2. Interval-Censored State Space Modeling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We extend the Mamba architecture to handle varying-length censored intervals through:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interval-aware vectors&lt;/strong> that encode time gaps and engagement counts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Time-dependent state transitions&lt;/strong> using matrix exponentials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Selective state processing&lt;/strong> through parallel pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h4 id="3-twotier-architecture">3. Two-Tier Architecture&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As shown in Figure 3, IC-Mamba uses a hierarchical approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tier 1&lt;/strong>: Models individual post engagement dynamics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tier 2&lt;/strong>: Captures temporal interactions between posts sharing the same opinion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="how-icmamba-works">How IC-Mamba Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="postlevel-engagement-prediction">Post-Level Engagement Prediction&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba's post-level prediction capabilities stem from its sophisticated handling of temporal dynamics and multi-modal information integration:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Unified Sequence Representation&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The model creates a comprehensive embedding for each post by combining:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SE(p) = Encoder([CLS] ⊕ [text] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [user] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [timeline] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [engagement])&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows IC-Mamba to jointly learn from textual content, user metadata, and temporal engagement patterns in a single unified framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Interval-Aware State Processing&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
For each observation time, the model constructs an interval-aware vector that captures:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time since last observation (Δt⁻)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current engagement levels (log(1 + e))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forward interval length (Δt⁺)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Predicted next engagement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This rich representation enables the model to understand not just what happened, but when and how quickly it occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Adaptive State Transitions&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The state space model adapts to varying observation intervals through:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>A_t(Δt) = exp(Δt · Ã_t)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This matrix exponential formulation allows smooth interpolation across irregular time gaps, maintaining temporal coherence even with sparse observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="opinionlevel-classification">Opinion-Level Classification&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba's exceptional performance in identifying misinformation narratives comes from its two-tier architecture and sophisticated temporal modeling:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Learning Opinion Signatures&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The first tier (IC-Mamba₁) processes individual posts to learn characteristic engagement patterns for different opinion types. Posts expressing similar opinions often exhibit similar temporal dynamics - for instance, conspiracy theories might show rapid initial spread followed by sustained engagement from dedicated communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Capturing Narrative Evolution&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The second tier (IC-Mamba₂) models how opinions spread across multiple posts:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>z_o = IC-Mamba₂((h_i, δt_i))&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>h_i&lt;/code>: Hidden representations from individual posts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>δt_i&lt;/code>: Time intervals between posts expressing the same opinion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This allows the model to identify coordinated campaigns where multiple accounts push similar narratives with strategic timing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Multi-Scale Temporal Features&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The model learns to distinguish between:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Organic discussions&lt;/strong>: Natural ebb and flow of engagement, constrained by human attention limits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Coordinated campaigns&lt;/strong>: Artificial amplification patterns, strategic timing, and sustained engagement beyond natural thresholds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Context-Aware Classification&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Unlike text-only approaches (like BERT), IC-Mamba incorporates:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Engagement velocity (how quickly reactions accumulate)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User network effects (who's sharing and when)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Temporal coordination (synchronized posting patterns)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-platform dynamics (when available)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This multi-faceted approach explains why IC-Mamba achieves F1 scores of 0.69-0.75 on organic content and maintains 0.51 performance even on sophisticated disinformation campaigns where text-only models fail dramatically.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;code>Δt&lt;/code>: Interval between observations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>exp(Δt · Ã_t)&lt;/code>: Matrix exponential for smooth interpolation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;code>L_temp = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||h_{j+1} - exp(Δt_j^+ · Ã_t)h_j||²&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion-a-tool-for-digital-defense">Conclusion: A Tool for Digital Defense&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba shows our ability to detect and predict the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. By providing early warnings &amp;ndash; often within 15-30 minutes of posting &amp;ndash; it offers platforms and researchers crucial time to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Identify potentially harmful content before mass exposure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Track coordinated information operations in real-time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design and implement targeted countermeasures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protect democratic discourse from manipulation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As misinformation continues to threaten social cohesion and democratic institutions, tools like IC-Mamba become essential components of our digital defense infrastructure. The model's ability to distinguish between organic discussions and coordinated campaigns, combined with its early detection capabilities, makes it a powerful ally in the fight against online manipulation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our digital age, the surge of online extremism brings forth urgent concerns such as hate speech normalization, user radicalization, and societal division. Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="interventions-in-the-online-opinion-ecosystem">Interventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-the-opinion-market-model">Our Solution: The Opinion Market Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions&amp;rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users&amp;rsquo; attention in the online realm.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="./featured.png" width="60%">
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \(S(t)\) (gray) and interventions \(X(t)\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity.
The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="datasets">Datasets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/strong> The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mainstream media cannot be trusted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires and climate change are not related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, &amp;hellip; , 5}}\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exogenous signal \(S(t)\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query &amp;ldquo;bushfire+climate change&amp;rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \({X_k(t)}\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset.&lt;/strong> We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \(S_i(t)\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \({X_k(t)}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="predicting-opinion-volumes-and-market-shares">Predicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="uncovering-latent-opinion-interactions">Uncovering Latent Opinion Interactions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions.&lt;/strong> Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-) and &amp;ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires&amp;rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion &amp;ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia&amp;rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO Artists.&lt;/strong> We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="omm-as-a-testbed-for-interventions">OMM as a Testbed for Interventions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can leverage the OMM in a &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\) separately. For Facebook, reputable news generally suppresses far-right opinions and most controversial news reinforces them, except for certain topics like &amp;ldquo;Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires&amp;rdquo; (\(R_0\)) and &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by arsonists.&amp;rdquo; (\(R_4\)) On Twitter, both reputable and controversial news suppress far-right opinions, except for reputable news related to certain topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The insights are twofold: firstly, Facebook's effect is moderate compared to Twitter due to Facebook's filter bubble nature. Secondly, indiscriminately increasing reputable news on Twitter can be ineffective and even counterproductive as it might attract more attention to far-right narratives and users (see \(R_3\) and \(R_4\)) [22].&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="problematic-speech-a-modern-plague">Problematic Speech: A Modern Plague&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Problematic speech is online interactions, speech, and artifacts that are inaccurate, misleading, inappropriately attributed, or altogether fabricated [1].
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic alerted the world to complex issues that arise from social media platforms circulating user-generated misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories [2].
There are several primary types of quantitative methods for addressing problematic information, including large-scale monitoring of social media datasets [3], understanding platforms, users, and networks contributing to the &amp;ldquo;infodemic&amp;rdquo; [4], and predicting future pathways of information spreading [5].
These studies provide valuable insights into understanding how problematic information spreads and detecting which sources are reshared frequently and by which accounts.
However, these approaches often have less to say about why certain opinions and views gain traction with vulnerable groups and online communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qualitative research methods are well placed to address this gap.
They provide rich, contextual insights into online communities&amp;rsquo; social beliefs, values, and practices, which shape how information is shared and how opinions are formed [6].
Nevertheless, a common criticism of qualitative research is that the in-depth knowledge comes at the expense of generating insights of limited representativeness and weak robustness of the findings.
Therefore, there is a gap between the depth of insight gained from ethnographic and qualitative approaches and the breadth of knowledge gained from computational methods from data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our work fills this gap by proposing a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative insights, large-scale data collection, and human-in-the-loop machine learning approaches.
We apply our method to map in-depth and in-breadth the problematic information around four topics:
&lt;em>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>Climate change&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>COVID-19&lt;/em>, and
&lt;em>Vaccination&lt;/em>
on three social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-mixing-digital-ethnography-with-advanced-machine-learning">Our Solution: Mixing Digital Ethnography with Advanced Machine Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig1.png" alt="The pipeline of machine learning accelerated qualitative research where the human-in-the-loop machine learning algorithms are employed for dataset augmentation.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present a complete solution that bridges and facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis to study problematic online speech.
The pipeline consists of three components which are detailed in this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deep-qualitative-study">Deep qualitative study&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first component is the qualitative study.
We build a platform based on an open-source tool, &lt;a href="https://wikiba.se/">&lt;em>Wikibase&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, where we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Through the quantitative study, we build an ontology of problematic online speech.
We label a large number of social media postings using their topics.
Simultaneously, we construct a vocabulary of 71 opinions that we also use to label postings.
Some example opinions include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis isn't real&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change is a UN hoax&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vaccines cause Autism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Health Organisation is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These opinions contain mistrust in the government and supra-national structures (e.g., UN, WHO) and typical misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="unlabeled-data-collection">Unlabeled data collection&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Qualitative approaches analyze emerging content and construct the vocabulary simultaneously when labeling the data.
However, they lack representativeness as they tend to be overly concentrated on narrow areas of the narrative landscape.
For this reason, the second step in our methodology involves collecting data at scale.
We collect large-scale raw data using the uncovered vocabulary from the deep qualitative study.
We construct keywords (shown in the table) for each topic to crawl social media data from three platforms.
We obtain a total of &lt;strong>13,321,813&lt;/strong> postings — &lt;strong>11,437,009&lt;/strong> Facebook postings, &lt;strong>1,793,927&lt;/strong> tweets and &lt;strong>90,877&lt;/strong> YouTube comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="keywords">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dataset-augmentation">Dataset augmentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The next step is to annotate all the postings in our dataset automatically.
We employ machine learning algorithms to augment the data labeling process with a human-in-the-loop setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By adopting the state-of-the-art text classification algorithm, RoBERTa [7,8], we first train the classifiers to identify problematic speech on postings annotated by the qualitative researchers.
Next, we deploy three strategies to select unlabeled data.
The active learning [9] strategy selects the data for which the classifiers are most uncertain.
The top-confidence strategy selects data that classifiers are most certain about.
The third strategy — the random strategy — randomly samples from unlabeled data.
The qualitative researchers then label the sampled data, introduce the newly labeled data in the ontology, and repeat the procedure iteratively until the predictive performance converges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="humanintheloop-performance">Human-in-the-loop Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We discuss here the convergence of prediction performance over labeling iterations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot depicts the prediction performance on the test set macro-averaged over topics (accuracy in the left panel and F1 score on the right panel) over iterations.
The solid lines show the performance indicators, together with the cross-validation generalization error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cross-validation performance is stable across iterations.
This is expected as the classifiers learn from the same data on which the generalization is estimated — i.e., the classifiers are representative of the data they were trained on.
However, the difference between the test set performance and cross-validation performance is indicative of the representativity over the entire dataset.
The cross-validation accuracy is consistently lower than the test set accuracy because the test data is more imbalanced than labeled data.
The cross-validation F1 is more optimistic than the test set F1.
Finally, the difference between the two stabilizes for the later iterations, further suggesting the convergence.
&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Convergence of topic classifier performances over seven iterations.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="applying-the-qualitative-mapping">Applying the Qualitative Mapping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We employ the obtained augmented labeled set to analyze the dynamics of problematic opinions at scale.
We machine-label the opinions in a large set of postings spanning over a long time, allowing us to apply the qualitative-defined coding schema to a significantly larger sample of postings.
This reduces the unavoidable selection bias of the deep qualitative study.
It also offers a critical tool for analyzing co-occurring opinions, which helps identify central opinions.
It is common for postings to express multiple opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We explore central opinions by building an opinion co-occurrence network in the online conversation of the topic &lt;strong>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/strong>.
In the network, nodes are the opinions captured during the bushfire conversation, while edges are present when both opinions are detected in the same postings.
The node degree of a given opinion node represents the number of opinions that co-occurred with it.
The edges are weighted by the number of postings in which their connected node opinions co-occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot presents each edge's daily proportions of weights among all edges between September 2019 and January 2020.
We show six edges (i.e., opinion pairs) to represent three types of temporal dynamics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A continuous and relatively strong association between prevalent opinions — &amp;ldquo;Climate change crisis isn't real&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax,&amp;rdquo; which not notably is a conspiracy theory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Associations with declining relative frequencies — &amp;ldquo;Greta Thunberg should not have a platform or influence as a climate&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women and girls don't deserve a voice in the public sphere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rising associations such as &amp;ldquo;bushfires and climate change not related&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo;; and also the conspiracy theory associations between &amp;ldquo;United Nations is corrupt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Daily proportions of edge weights of six selected co-occurred opinions pairs.">&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the following plot, we map the co-occurrence network from posts published over 14 days in late September 2019, i.e., the period when the betweenness for conspiracy opinions is at peak.
This figure explains the ambivalent network role that conspiracy opinions can play: we first note a conspiracy opinion with relatively high degree and frequency — &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax&amp;rdquo; —, while we also observe the presence of low degree but high betweenness conspiracy opinions at the periphery of the network — &amp;ldquo;Bushfires linked to secret elites&amp;rsquo; secret technology (chemtrails, HAARP, HSRN, geoengineering)&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;bushfires deliberately lit to promote a climate change agenda&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Australia should not be a member of the United Nations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>‘Fake news’ and broader ‘information disorders’ [6] such as mis- and disinformation have emerged as global issues that threaten to undermine democracy and authentic political communication on social media [1]. Increasingly sophisticated coordination strategies have intensified the scale and scope of the impact that disinformation has on public opinion and democratic trust. Howard et al. [3] found that coordinated disinformation operations are now occurring in 48 countries, and in 2019 the European External Action Service detected and exposed over 1,000 cases of disinformation within the European Union [2]. Whilst disinformation has attracted much scholarly attention, most studies to date have focussed on the diffusion and impact of individual content (e.g. ‘fake news’ articles) and the activity of individual accounts (e.g. bots and trolls).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An emerging problem is to understand message coordination strategies, where content authored and distributed by agents (e.g. Twitter trolls) is governed and scheduled by some unknown principal actor [4]. We know that coordinated promotion (e.g. sharing, liking, retweeting) of ‘fake news’ articles by trolls and social bots can greatly increase and amplify the negative effects of these attempts to sow discord and manipulate public conversations about election candidates and partisan issues such as immigration and climate change. Likewise, it is evident that disinformation campaigns unfold via ‘collaborative work’ that co-opts and cultivates organic systems in order to produce desired effects such as increased polarisation, distrust in news media and confusion of the audience [7]. This makes identifying ‘inauthentic’ versus ‘organic’ activity ever more difficult, as they are intricately enmeshed in real-world disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring the coordinated promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ articles using a novel approach known as Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP; see [5]). We analyse the diffusion of articles from ten major sources of hyperpartisan information and ‘fake news’ within over 16.5 million tweets that linked to content from these sites during July to September 2019. Using HIP, we uncover not only coordination strategies but also the promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ content, where agents (in this case Twitter accounts) are being centrally managed by principals (e.g. state operatives, government officials, etc.) in order to strategically promote ‘fake news’ content and maximise its virality and longevity in the social memory. This paper provides preliminary results from this ongoing research, highlighting the current challenges as well as open problems and gaps for future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-panel-coordinated-inauthentic-behaviour-in-social-media-new-methods-and-findings">The panel: &amp;ldquo;Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour in Social Media: New Methods and Findings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="panel-rationale">Panel Rationale&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Social media platforms are increasingly forced to address what Facebook now describes as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (Gleicher 2018): online influence operations that seek to trick platform algorithms into promoting and recommending ‘problematic information’ (Jack 2017), to mislead the human users of such platforms into accepting and sharing such content, and thereby also to affect broader issue frames and news agendas in mainstream media coverage. Concerns about such coordinated inauthentic behaviour extend earlier fears about the influence of malignant social bots, but also transcend them: drawing on social bots as well as human labour, coordinated inauthentic behaviour is likely to involve a combination of manual and automated activity. This additional human factor also complicates the detection of such coordinated activities, and their distinction from genuine, organic, authentic coordinated actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cross-national and interdisciplinary panel approaches the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour from a number of directions. It outlines novel and innovative detection and analysis approaches for a number of leading social media platforms, and presents their results in the context of domestic and international political debates across several national contexts. Further, it also considers how mainstream journalism might report on and respond to such activities in order to protect news audiences from being affected by coordinated inauthentic behaviours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two papers in this panel focus especially on coordinated inauthentic link-sharing practices. Paper 1 introduces Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP), a novel technique for inferring the coordinated content promotion schedules of automated social media accounts, and applies this to a major dataset of 16.5 million tweets containing links to ten major sites identified as sources of hyperpartisan content and ‘fake news’. In doing so, it uncovers new networks of inauthentic Twitter actors. Paper 2 investigates similar coordinated link-sharing activity on Facebook in Italy during the 2018 Italian and 2019 European elections. It uncovers evidence for the involvement of dozens of pages, groups, and public profiles in such media manipulation attempts. Paper 3 complements this work by focussing especially on the temporal posting patterns in such coordinated activity. It employs the recurrence plotting technique to identify traces of inauthentic actors’ use of automated scheduling tools in systematically posting content to a network of apparently unrelated pages, focussing here especially on a group of far-right pages on Facebook. Paper 4 examines ten coordinated disinformation campaigns across the globe (e.g., Hong Kong, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany) and identifies important traits that help distinguish between those participating in the disinformation campaign and the regular users they try to imitate. Paper 5, finally, shifts our attention to a core target of such coordinated inauthentic behaviour: the journalists and editors whose perception of current political moods such influence operations often aim to affect. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with Danish news workers and related stakeholders, it examines their understanding of and responses to coordinated mis- and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collectively, these studies contribute substantially to advancing the methodological toolkit and extending the empirical evidence base for the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, while also not losing sight of the stakeholders that such work seeks to support. They offer an independent assessment of the nature and extent of the problem across several leading social media platforms, complementing the platform providers’ own investigations into such activities and identifying possible responses to such concerns for both social and mainstream media actors.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- Motivation -->
&lt;!-- Framing: Problem -> Solution -->
&lt;!-- Context -->
&lt;p>Social media platforms, although relatively new, host millions of users and billions of interactions daily. As tied as we are to these platforms, they profoundly impact our social institutions through phenomena such as disinformation, political polarization, and social bots.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Problem -->
&lt;p>Researchers are increasingly interested in trying to form an understanding of phenomena and their implications. Social scientists, political scientists, and data practitioners alike curate expansive datasets to combat these potentially adverse effects on our society; however, they lack the appropriate tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Solution -->
&lt;p>&lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is an &lt;strong>easy-to-use&lt;/strong> tool that models Twitter users&amp;rsquo; attributes and labels them. It comes prepackaged with a &lt;strong>state-of-the-art bot detector&lt;/strong> and an &lt;strong>influence quantification&lt;/strong> system based on tweet dynamics. &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> features a generalized user labeler, which can be retrained easily with the engineered features to address a variety of use cases. Also, &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml/">birdspotter.ml&lt;/a> is a web application that can be utilized to explore datasets and derive a narrative around a dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I'll showcase the basic usage of &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> and &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml/">birdspotter.ml&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The package can be installed in the canonical python way:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{bash}">pip install birdspotter
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="getting-a-dataset">Getting a dataset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Twitter T&amp;amp;Cs restrict the sharing of tweet data directly online; however, they do allow the sharing of tweet-ids, which can be converted to full tweet data through a process called &lt;em>hydration&lt;/em>. Tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">twarc&lt;/a> can be used to hydrate a Tweet ID dataset. The resulting dataset will be in &lt;code>jsonl&lt;/code> (line delimited &lt;code>json&lt;/code>) format, which &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> accepts directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the below examples, we use two datasets; a collection of COVID-19 related tweets from January 31st, 2020 [1], and a collection of tweets about politicians on Twitter [2].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The politicians&amp;rsquo; dataset was acquired through the following process (and a similar process was taken for the COVID-19 dataset):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{bash}">pip install twarc
wget http://twitterpoliticians.org./downloads/base/all_tweet_ids.csv
twarc hydrate all_tweet_ids.csv &amp;gt; tweets.jsonl
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The code below imports the main class &lt;code>Birdspotter&lt;/code>, extracts the tweets from their standard format, labels the users with the default bot detector and influence, and reformats the retweet cascades into a tidier format.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{python}">## Import birdspotter
from birdspotter import BirdSpotter
## Extracts the tweets from the raw jsonl [https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs]
bs = BirdSpotter('covid19.jsonl')
## Uses the default bot labeller and influence quantification systems
bs.getLabeledUsers()
## Formats the retweet cascades, such that expected retweet structures can extracted
bs.getCascadesDataFrame()
## Access the botness labels and influence scores
bs.featureDataframe[['botness', 'influence']]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From here, the dataset is readily profile-able:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{python}">botness_dist = sns.histplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=&amp;quot;botness&amp;quot;)
influence_eccdf = sns.ecdfplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=&amp;quot;influence&amp;quot;, complementary=True).set(xscale=&amp;quot;log&amp;quot;, yscale=&amp;quot;log&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.behavioral-ds.science/img/covid_profile.png" alt="COVID Dataset Profile: (Left) The distribution of bot scores of users; (Right) The ECCDF of influence scores of users, showing a long-tailed (rich-gets-richer) paradigm">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-visualizer">The visualizer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An alternative way to profile a dataset is the use &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml">&lt;code>birdspotter.ml&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, which facilitates dataset exploration and narrative construction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.behavioral-ds.science/img/auspol_teaser.png" alt="birdspotter.ml visualizer: The various components shown include the scatterplot panel (Left), the user information panel (Top Right), and the retweet cascades panel (Bottom Right)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The visualizer features a scatterplot (on the left) of influence and botness for a sample of users and the population density. The colors represent the hashtags (a proxy for the topic) that the users most tweet about in the dataset. Users within the scatterplot are hoverable and selectable, and their information populates in the components on the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The top right component shows information and metrics about the selected user and links the user's profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom right component shows the retweet cascades where a user has participated and highlights their participation. The points represent the follower counts (social capital) of users and their retweets/tweets&amp;rsquo; timing. The points are also hoverable and selectable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customising-the-labeller">Customising the labeller&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default, the labeler is trained as a bot detection system, comparable to the state-of-the-art &lt;a href="https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/">&lt;code>botometer&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. Notable, &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is provided in an offline package and can be applied at scale, while &lt;code>botometer&lt;/code> is accessible only via an online API, which is often prohibitively rate-limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is a versatile tool and can be utilized by practitioners for a variety of use-cases. For example, we could train the labeler to identify political leaning. This process is a bit involved, so we summarise it below;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We hydrate some tweets from the Twitter Parlimentarian Database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We filter the tweets to include only &lt;strong>Australian Politicians&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We &lt;strong>label right-wing partied politicians positively&lt;/strong>, and others negatively (with &lt;code>bs_pol.getBotAnnotationTemplate&lt;/code> for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We &lt;strong>retrain &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> with these new labels and label all users (i.e., including users the politicians retweeted) using the new model&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="dataset">Dataset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this tutorial, we apply two tools for analyzing Twitter users, on a COVID-19 retweet dataset. The dataset
is curated by Chen, et al. One can obtain a copy of the tweet IDs from
their &lt;a href="https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs">project&lt;/a>. We
only use the 31st of Janury sample of the whole dataset for
demonstration purpose. The tweets can be recovered by &lt;code>hydration&lt;/code>
from their IDs. We note that some tweets might have been deleted and in
the end we manage to get 69.2% (1,489,877) of the original tweets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While &lt;code>BirdSpotter&lt;/code> captures the social influence and botness of Twitter
users, &lt;code>evently&lt;/code> specifically models the temporal dynamics of online
information diffusion. We leverage information provided by the tools to
study the users in the COVID19 dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">library(evently)
library(reticulate)
birdspotter &amp;lt;- import('birdspotter')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="preprocessing-tweets">Preprocessing tweets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this step, we seek to extract diffusion cascades from the &lt;code>COVID-19&lt;/code>
dataset for analyzing user influence and botness. A diffusion cascade
consist of an initial tweet posted by a Twitter user and followed then
by a sereis of retweets. A function provided by &lt;code>evently&lt;/code> allows one to
obtain cascades from JSON formatted raw tweets. On the other hand, we
initialize a &lt;code>BirdSpotter&lt;/code> instance and compute the influence and
botness scores for all users in the
dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">cascades &amp;lt;- parse_raw_tweets_to_cascades('corona_2020_01_31.jsonl', keep_user = T, keep_absolute_time = T)
bs &amp;lt;- birdspotter$BirdSpotter('corona_2020_01_31.jsonl')
labeled_users &amp;lt;- bs$getLabeledUsers()[, c('user_id', 'botness', 'influence')]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As we cannot publish &lt;code>corona_2020_01_31.jsonl&lt;/code> due to Twitter TOC, we
have stored the results and load them below&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">load('corona_2020_01_31.rda')
labeled_users &amp;lt;- read.csv('corona_31_botness_influence.csv', stringsAsFactors = F,
colClasses=c(&amp;quot;character&amp;quot;,rep(&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;,3)))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We note that all user IDs have been encrypted. After obtaining the
results, let’s first conduct some simple measurements on users and
cascades.&lt;/p>
