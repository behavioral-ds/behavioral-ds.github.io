&lt;p>On October 28, 2017, an anonymous 4chan user made a cryptic post claiming Hillary Clinton would be arrested within days. Four years later, on January 6, 2021, devotees of the QAnon conspiracy theory - which originated from that very post - stormed the U.S. Capitol in an act that left five people dead and over 140 police officers injured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tragic event underscores a critical question:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What if we could have seen this coming?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we're introducing IC-Mamba, a state-of-the-art model that can forecast social media engagement patterns and detect viral misinformation before it spirals out of control. By modeling the complex temporal dynamics of how content spreads online, IC-Mamba achieves unprecedented accuracy in predicting which posts will go viral - often within just 15-30 minutes of publication.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Social media platforms don't provide continuous streams of engagement data. Instead, they offer snapshots at irregular intervals - what we call &amp;ldquo;interval-censored&amp;rdquo; data. As illustrated in Figure 1, while users interact with content continuously, platforms only report cumulative counts at discrete observation points.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. Illustration of interval-censored social media engagement data. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This creates unique challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Irregular sampling&lt;/strong>: Observation intervals vary from minutes to hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cumulative counts&lt;/strong>: We only see totals, not individual actions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multi-scale dynamics&lt;/strong>: Engagement patterns evolve from rapid initial spread to long-term influence&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="icmamba-a-novel-architecture-for-early-detection">IC-Mamba: A Novel Architecture for Early Detection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba combines three key components to tackle these challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="1-timeaware-positional-embeddings">1. Time-Aware Positional Embeddings&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We developed a dual encoding strategy that captures both relative and absolute temporal relationships:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE)&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>RTE(t, t_ref) = sin((t - t_ref) / σ)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Absolute Temporal Encoding (ATE)&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>ATE(t) = [sin(t/10000^(2i/d)), cos(t/10000^(2i/d))]&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These embeddings are then modulated by observed engagement levels, allowing the model to learn characteristic temporal patterns associated with different levels of social impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="2-intervalcensored-state-space-modeling">2. Interval-Censored State Space Modeling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We extend the Mamba architecture to handle varying-length censored intervals through:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interval-aware vectors&lt;/strong> that encode time gaps and engagement counts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Time-dependent state transitions&lt;/strong> using matrix exponentials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Selective state processing&lt;/strong> through parallel pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h4 id="3-twotier-architecture">3. Two-Tier Architecture&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As shown in Figure 3, IC-Mamba uses a hierarchical approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tier 1&lt;/strong>: Models individual post engagement dynamics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tier 2&lt;/strong>: Captures temporal interactions between posts sharing the same opinion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="how-icmamba-works">How IC-Mamba Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="postlevel-engagement-prediction">Post-Level Engagement Prediction&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba's post-level prediction capabilities stem from its sophisticated handling of temporal dynamics and multi-modal information integration:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Unified Sequence Representation&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The model creates a comprehensive embedding for each post by combining:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SE(p) = Encoder([CLS] ⊕ [text] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [user] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [timeline] ⊕ [SEP] ⊕ [engagement])&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows IC-Mamba to jointly learn from textual content, user metadata, and temporal engagement patterns in a single unified framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Interval-Aware State Processing&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
For each observation time, the model constructs an interval-aware vector that captures:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time since last observation (Δt⁻)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current engagement levels (log(1 + e))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forward interval length (Δt⁺)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Predicted next engagement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This rich representation enables the model to understand not just what happened, but when and how quickly it occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Adaptive State Transitions&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The state space model adapts to varying observation intervals through:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>A_t(Δt) = exp(Δt · Ã_t)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This matrix exponential formulation allows smooth interpolation across irregular time gaps, maintaining temporal coherence even with sparse observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="opinionlevel-classification">Opinion-Level Classification&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba's exceptional performance in identifying misinformation narratives comes from its two-tier architecture and sophisticated temporal modeling:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Learning Opinion Signatures&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The first tier (IC-Mamba₁) processes individual posts to learn characteristic engagement patterns for different opinion types. Posts expressing similar opinions often exhibit similar temporal dynamics - for instance, conspiracy theories might show rapid initial spread followed by sustained engagement from dedicated communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Capturing Narrative Evolution&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The second tier (IC-Mamba₂) models how opinions spread across multiple posts:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>z_o = IC-Mamba₂((h_i, δt_i))&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>h_i&lt;/code>: Hidden representations from individual posts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>δt_i&lt;/code>: Time intervals between posts expressing the same opinion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This allows the model to identify coordinated campaigns where multiple accounts push similar narratives with strategic timing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Multi-Scale Temporal Features&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The model learns to distinguish between:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Organic discussions&lt;/strong>: Natural ebb and flow of engagement, constrained by human attention limits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Coordinated campaigns&lt;/strong>: Artificial amplification patterns, strategic timing, and sustained engagement beyond natural thresholds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Context-Aware Classification&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Unlike text-only approaches (like BERT), IC-Mamba incorporates:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Engagement velocity (how quickly reactions accumulate)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User network effects (who's sharing and when)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Temporal coordination (synchronized posting patterns)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-platform dynamics (when available)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This multi-faceted approach explains why IC-Mamba achieves F1 scores of 0.69-0.75 on organic content and maintains 0.51 performance even on sophisticated disinformation campaigns where text-only models fail dramatically.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;code>exp(Δt · Ã_t)&lt;/code>: Matrix exponential for smooth interpolation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;code>L_temp = (1/|P|) Σ_p Σ_j ||h_{j+1} - exp(Δt_j^+ · Ã_t)h_j||²&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion-a-tool-for-digital-defense">Conclusion: A Tool for Digital Defense&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba shows our ability to detect and predict the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. By providing early warnings &amp;ndash; often within 15-30 minutes of posting &amp;ndash; it offers platforms and researchers crucial time to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Identify potentially harmful content before mass exposure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Track coordinated information operations in real-time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design and implement targeted countermeasures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protect democratic discourse from manipulation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As misinformation continues to threaten social cohesion and democratic institutions, tools like IC-Mamba become essential components of our digital defense infrastructure. The model's ability to distinguish between organic discussions and coordinated campaigns, combined with its early detection capabilities, makes it a powerful ally in the fight against online manipulation.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion-a-tool-for-digital-defense">Conclusion: A Tool for Digital Defense&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IC-Mamba shows our ability to detect and predict the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. By providing early warnings &amp;ndash; often within 15-30 minutes of posting &amp;ndash; it offers platforms and researchers crucial time to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Identify potentially harmful content before mass exposure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Track coordinated information operations in real-time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design and implement targeted countermeasures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protect democratic discourse from manipulation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As misinformation continues to threaten social cohesion and democratic institutions, tools like IC-Mamba become essential components of our digital defense infrastructure. The model's ability to distinguish between organic discussions and coordinated campaigns, combined with its early detection capabilities, makes it a powerful ally in the fight against online manipulation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In today’s fractured online landscape, it is harder than ever to identify harmful actors such as trolls and misinformation spreaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Often, efforts to spot malicious accounts focus on analysing what they say. However, our latest research suggests we should be paying more attention to what they do – and how they do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have developed a way to identify potentially harmful online actors based solely on their behavioural patterns – the way they interact with others – rather than the content they share. We presented our results at the recent ACM Web Conference, and were awarded Best Paper.

&lt;p>Traditional approaches to spotting problematic online behaviour typically rely on two methods. One is to examine content (what people are saying). The other is to analyse network connections (who follows whom).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Users can circumvent content analysis. They may code their language carefully, or share misleading information without using obvious trigger words.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Users can circumvent content analysis. They may code their language carefully, or share misleading information without using obvious trigger words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Network analysis falls short on platforms such as Reddit. Here, connections between users aren’t explicit. Communities are organised around topics rather than social relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to find a way to identify harmful actors that couldn’t be easily gamed. We realised we could, focusing on behaviour – how people interact, rather than what they say.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="teaching-ai-to-understand-human-behaviour-online">Teaching AI to understand human behaviour online&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our approach uses a technique called inverse reinforcement learning. This is a method typically used to understand human decision-making in fields such as autonomous driving or game theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We adapted this technology to analyse how users behave on social media platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system works by observing a user’s actions, such as creating new threads, posting comments and replying to others. From those actions it infers the underlying strategy or “policy” that drives their behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our Reddit case study, we analysed 5.9 million interactions over six years. We identified five distinct behavioural personas, including one particularly notable group – “disagreers”.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="meet-the-disagreers">Meet the ‘disagreers’&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Perhaps our most striking result was finding an entire class of Reddit users whose primary purpose seems to be to disagree with others. These users specifically seek out opportunities to post contradictory comments, especially in response to disagreement, and then move on without waiting for replies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The “disagreers” were most common in politically-focused subreddits (forums focused on particular topics) such as r/news, r/worldnews, and r/politics. Interestingly, they were much less common in the now-banned pro-Trump forum r/The_Donald despite its political focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pattern reveals how behavioural analysis can uncover dynamics that content analysis might miss. In r/The_Donald, users tended to agree with each other while directing hostility toward outside targets. This dynamic may explain why traditional content moderation has struggled to address problems in such communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="soccer-fans-and-gamers">Soccer fans and gamers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our research also revealed unexpected connections. Users discussing completely different topics sometimes displayed remarkably similar behavioural patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We found striking similarities between users discussing soccer (on r/soccer) and e-sports (on r/leagueoflegends).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This similarity emerges from the fundamental nature of both communities. Soccer and e-sports fans engage in parallel ways: they passionately support specific teams, follow matches with intense interest, participate in heated discussions about strategies and player performances, celebrate victories, and dissect defeats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both communities foster strong tribal identities. Users defend their favoured teams while critiquing rivals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether debating Premier League tactics or League of Legends champions, the underlying interaction patterns – the timing, sequence and emotional tone of responses – remain consistent across these topically distinct communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenges conventional wisdom about online polarisation. While echo chambers are often blamed for increasing division, our research suggests behavioural patterns can transcend topical boundaries. Users may be divided more by how they interact than what they discuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beyond-troll-detection">Beyond troll detection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The implications of this research extend well beyond academic interest. Platform moderators could use behavioural patterns to identify potentially problematic users before they’ve posted large volumes of harmful content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike content moderation, behavioural analysis does not depend on understanding language. It is hard to evade, since changing one’s behavioural patterns requires more effort than adjusting language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach could also help design more effective strategies to counter misinformation. Rather than focusing solely on the content, we can design systems that encourage more constructive engagement patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For social media users, this research offers a reminder that how we engage online – not just what we say – shapes our digital identity and influences others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As online spaces continue to grapple with manipulation, harassment and polarisation, approaches that consider behavioural patterns alongside content analysis may offer more effective solutions for fostering healthier online communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Reddit users just love to disagree, new AI-powered troll-spotting algorithm finds</title><link>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme1_content/irl_homophily/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme1_content/irl_homophily/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a repost of our article from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/some-reddit-users-just-love-to-disagree-new-ai-powered-troll-spotting-algorithm-finds-255879">The Conversation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our digital age, the surge of online extremism brings forth urgent concerns such as hate speech normalization, user radicalization, and societal division. Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="interventions-in-the-online-opinion-ecosystem">Interventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-the-opinion-market-model">Our Solution: The Opinion Market Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions&amp;rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users&amp;rsquo; attention in the online realm.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="./featured.png" width="60%">
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \(S(t)\) (gray) and interventions \(X(t)\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity.
The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="datasets">Datasets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/strong> The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mainstream media cannot be trusted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires and climate change are not related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, &amp;hellip; , 5}}\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exogenous signal \(S(t)\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query &amp;ldquo;bushfire+climate change&amp;rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \({X_k(t)}\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset.&lt;/strong> We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \(S_i(t)\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \({X_k(t)}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="predicting-opinion-volumes-and-market-shares">Predicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="uncovering-latent-opinion-interactions">Uncovering Latent Opinion Interactions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions.&lt;/strong> Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-) and &amp;ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires&amp;rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion &amp;ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia&amp;rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO Artists.&lt;/strong> We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="omm-as-a-testbed-for-interventions">OMM as a Testbed for Interventions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can leverage the OMM in a &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\) separately. For Facebook, reputable news generally suppresses far-right opinions and most controversial news reinforces them, except for certain topics like &amp;ldquo;Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires&amp;rdquo; (\(R_0\)) and &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by arsonists.&amp;rdquo; (\(R_4\)) On Twitter, both reputable and controversial news suppress far-right opinions, except for reputable news related to certain topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The insights are twofold: firstly, Facebook's effect is moderate compared to Twitter due to Facebook's filter bubble nature. Secondly, indiscriminately increasing reputable news on Twitter can be ineffective and even counterproductive as it might attract more attention to far-right narratives and users (see \(R_3\) and \(R_4\)) [22].&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our digital age, the surge of online extremism brings forth urgent concerns such as hate speech normalization, user radicalization, and societal division. Counteracting these issues calls for exploring mitigation strategies, be it through negative interventions, an example of which is the EU’s Digital Services Act seeking to regulate deletion of harmful content, or positive interventions strategically introduced into the opinion landscape to boost certain opinions. In our latest work (to be presented at ICWSM 2024), we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM) as a testbed to simulate and measure the impact of positive interventions on online opinion dynamics. Additionally, we show the OMM’s capability to detect possible backfiring of debunking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, we delve into OMM's structure and demonstrate its ability to uncover cooperation-competition relations across online opinions about (a) Australian bushfires and (b) popular VEVO artists, and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinion.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="interventions-in-the-online-opinion-ecosystem">Interventions in the Online Opinion Ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Online social media platforms are breeding grounds for discourse, fostering both cooperation and competition among opinions vying for limited public attention [1]. Two distinct intervention strategies have emerged to counter extremist views in the online landscape. Negative interventions operate by diverting attention away from certain opinions, employing measures such as fact-check alerts [2], shadow-banning [3], and outright banning of extremist content [4]. While these methods have proven effective [5], they are predominantly within the control of social media platforms that use them sparingly [6]. Conversely, positive interventions [7], including debunking misinformation [8] and amplifying media coverage [9], combat extremism by boosting certain opinions, often under the purview of governmental and media entities [10].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of positive interventions requires the ability (1) to disentangle inter-opinion interactions from the reaction of opinions to interventions and (2) to test the sensitivity of the opinion ecosystem to interventions. We propose the Opinion Market Model handle these two issues effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-the-opinion-market-model">Our Solution: The Opinion Market Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Opinion Market Model (OMM) models online opinion dynamics resulting from inter-opinion interactions and positive interventions&amp;rsquo; influence. Drawing an analogy from economic markets, the model views opinions as analogous to economic goods. Just as goods can compete or reinforce each other's market share, online opinions can engage in similar dynamics—competing for limited online attention or complementing each other. This analogy allows for applying market share attraction models [11], aiding in understanding opinion interactions and their competition for users&amp;rsquo; attention in the online realm.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="./featured.png" width="60%">
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 1. The OMM as a two-tier model of the online opinion ecosystem.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMM models the online opinion ecosystem across two tiers: online attention volumes and opinion market shares. Illustrated in Figure 1 is a simplified scenario with two opinions (labeled 0 and 1) on a social media platform. Each opinion is assumed to have two stances denoting far-right support (+) and moderate views (-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of system inputs (top row of Figure 1), the OMM makes a distinction between exogenous signals \(S(t)\) (gray) and interventions \(X(t)\) (yellow) to influence online opinions. Exogenous signals modulate the dynamics of the opinions’ sizes and represent events like natural disasters or speeches. Interventions (such as increased media coverage) are designed to add attention to the opinion ecosystem, increasing the market share of certain opinions while suppressing others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first tier (middle row of Figure 1) uses a discrete-time Hawkes process [12] to estimate opinion attention volumes (i.e. the daily number of postings featuring opinions) driven by both exogenous signals and the self-exciting nature of online popularity.
The second tier (bottom row of Figure 1) uses a market share attraction model to capture both inter-opinion interactions, either cooperative or competitive and driven by limited online user attention, and their response to positive interventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="datasets">Datasets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We utilize two real-world datasets to showcase the predictive and interpretative capabilities of the OMM. Below, we give a short description of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/strong> The Bushfire Opinions dataset contains 90 days of Twitter and Facebook discussions about bushfires and climate change between 1 November 2019 to 29 January 2020. We filter and label relevant Facebook and Twitter postings using the textual topic and opinion classifiers developed in [13] into six opinions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Greens policies are the cause of the Australian bushfires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mainstream media cannot be trusted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis is not real / is a UN hoax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires and climate change are not related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To distinguish between moderate (-) and far-right (+) opinions, we utilize the far-right stance detector in [14], which employs a measure of textual homophily to gauge the similarity between Twitter users and established far-right figures. Our set of opinions is denoted as \({(i−, i+)|i ∈ {0, &amp;hellip; , 5}}\). In total, we analyze data from two platforms, encompassing 74,461 tweets and 7,974 Facebook posts, all labeled with 12 distinct stanced opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exogenous signal \(S(t)\) is defined as the 5-day rolling average of the Google Trends query &amp;ldquo;bushfire+climate change&amp;rdquo; in Australia, functioning as a representation of general interest and offline occurrences [15]. For positive interventions \({X_k(t)}\), we incorporate reputable (R) and controversial (C) news coverage from Australian and international sources. Reputable sources are drawn from the Reputable News Index (RNIX) [16], while controversial international sources are accessed through NELA-GT-2019 [17].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset.&lt;/strong> We evaluate the OMM on a second dataset obtained by aligning artist-level time series of YouTube views and Twitter post counts for the top 10 VEVO-affiliated artists over a span of 100 days from 2 January 2017, to 11 April 2017. The YouTube data from the VEVO Music Graph dataset [18] encompasses daily view counts for music videos by verified VEVO artists across six English-speaking countries. Twitter post counts are collected through the Twitter API, using the artist's name as the input query. Unlike the Bushfire Opinions dataset, here we utilize distinct exogenous signals for each artist, referred to as \(S_i(t)\), derived from Google Trends. Our focus for the VEVO 2017 Top 10 dataset is uncovering intrinsic interactions among artists; hence, we leave out interventions \({X_k(t)}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="predicting-opinion-volumes-and-market-shares">Predicting Opinion Volumes and Market Shares&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since OMM is a two-tier model, we can evaluate its predictive capabilities on two levels: (1) predicting opinion volumes and (2) predicting opinion shares. In the first task, we forecast the total volume of opinionated posts across each considered online platform during the prediction period after training on the training period. In the second task, we predict the market shares for each opinion on each platform during the prediction period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 2. Fitting and predicting with OMM on the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fig. 2(a) illustrates the alignment between observed (blue line) and modeled (orange line) opinion volumes in the bushfire dataset. Notably, we fit well within both training and prediction periods. In Fig. 2(b), the distribution of observed (left column) and fitted/predicted (right column) opinion market shares for the bushfire dataset are showcased. Again, OMM adeptly captures trends in opinion shares across both platforms. We also compare (see full text) the OMM to a multivariate linear regression baseline and state-of-the-art models in product share modeling (the Correlated Cascades model [19] and the Competing Products model [20]), and show superior performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="uncovering-latent-opinion-interactions">Uncovering Latent Opinion Interactions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To understand the interactions of opinions with one another, we borrow the economic concept of elasticity and derive opinion share model elasticities from the OMM. These quantify the instantaneous competition-cooperation interactions across opinions, capturing both the direct effect of an opinion on another and the indirect effect of an opinion across other opinions. Elasticities are signed metrics: if positive we observe a cooperative relation, if negative a competitive relation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 3. (a) Inter-opinion OMM elasticities in the Bushfire Opinions dataset. (b) Youtube elasticities in the VEVO Top 10 dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bushfire Opinions.&lt;/strong> Figure 3(a) shows the inter-opinion elasticities for the Bushfire Opinions dataset derived from the fitted OMM model. Within Twitter we observe substantial self-reinforcement among opinions, a sign of the echo chamber effect [21]. In addition, we see significant cross-reinforcement between far-right sympathizers and opponents, suggesting interactions or debates between opposing viewpoints. For Facebook, OMM identifies limited interaction between opinions due to Facebook far-right groups acting as a filter bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results suggest that to suppress far-right opinions effectively we should avoid direct confrontation, which might unintentionally attract more attention to them. Instead, a more successful approach is to promote counter-arguments related to the far-right opinions. For example, on Twitter, to diminish the impact of the opinion &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4+), the Opinion Market Model (OMM) suggests boosting opinions like &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-) and &amp;ldquo;Greens are not the cause of the bushfires&amp;rdquo; (0-). However, promoting the opposing view, such as &amp;ldquo;Australian bushfires were not caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo; (4-), could actually backfire. Interestingly, the opinion &amp;ldquo;Bushfires are a normal summer occurrence in Australia&amp;rdquo; (5+) takes a different approach—it reinforces most moderate opinions and discourages far-right ones. Notably, this opinion (5+) seems to trigger &amp;ldquo;Climate change is real&amp;rdquo; (2-), possibly due to the stark contrast between these viewpoints. This effect is consistent across different platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VEVO Artists.&lt;/strong> We show the fitted Youtube elasticities for the VEVO artists in Figure 3(b). We make three observations. Firstly, strong self-reinforcement exists for most artists, reflecting their dedicated fanbases. Secondly, the OMM captures significant artist interactions that align with real-world events and relationships. For example, it detects how Calvin Harris inhibits both Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, possibly linked to their past conflicts, while Harris&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Ariana Grande reinforces their positive relationship. Lastly, the unique relationships between artists (Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande) within the same genre (mainstream pop) highlight the intricate nature of fanbase dynamics, showing that similar artists can have diverse pairwise interactions rather than solely cooperating or competing for attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="omm-as-a-testbed-for-interventions">OMM as a Testbed for Interventions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Positive interventions can have delayed impacts on the opinion ecosystem due to the interconnectedness of opinions. When an intervention boosts a particular opinion, it also indirectly boosts opinions that cooperate with it while inhibiting competitive opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can leverage the OMM in a &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; scenario to understand long-term effects of media coverage in the bushfire case study. By synthetically varying intervention sizes, the OMM can serve as a testbed for prioritizing interventions and for designing A/B tests to determine causal impacts. The setup involves changing intervention volumes after a certain time, and then measuring the resulting percentage change in far-right opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./omm_4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Figure 4. OMM-simulated percent changes in the far-right (+) opinion market shares on Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) by modulating the volume of reputable (R) and controversial (C) news for each opinion in the Bushfire Opinions dataset.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figure 4 illustrates the average percentage changes in the market share of far-right opinions when manipulating the interventions \({R_i(t), C_i(t)}\) separately.

&lt;h2>Ideology in an Online World&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideology determines how we make sense of much of the world, our opinions, and our political actions.
It is not a new concept; throughout history, it served as the context for unrest.
However, ideological spread and radicalization have entered a new paradigm in our ever-connected world. The internet is a significant source of information and spreads opinions quickly through social platforms.
In particular, the anonymity and lack of accountability often associated with online communication set up a supportive environment for spreading far-right ideologies and radicalizing individuals into extremist groups.
Far-right extremism is a form of ideology that advocates for ultranationalism, racism, and opposition to immigration and multiculturalism.
These ideologies strongly correlate with violence and terrorism and threaten individual and collective security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raised concerns about Australians being radicalized very young and the rise of extremist movements in Australia through online technologies &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-asio" role="doc-biblioref">&lt;span>“Director-General’s Annual Threat Assessment”&lt;/span> 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.
ASIO claimed that during the COVID period, 30-40% of their caseload was devoted to far-right extremism, up from 10-15% in 2016 &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-guardian1" role="doc-biblioref">Karp 2020&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE) continues to be an issue in Australia.
On December 12th, 2022, two Queensland police officers were killed while performing routine duties &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-guardian2" role="doc-biblioref">Gillespie and McGowan 2022&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.
Later investigations would uncover that the three people, who killed the officers, were active online in producing deep-state and religious conspiratorial content.
Their content has since been removed from mainstream social platforms but continues to be shared on conspiratorial websites.
Such extreme-leaning content often serves as a lead indicator of violent extremism (as was the case in this incident and the Christchurch Mosque Shootings three years prior). However, the tools to identify and understand the psychosocial characteristics of these extreme individuals and communities are lacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this work, we build an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline and psychosocial profiles of ideological groups.
We find that right-leaning individuals tend to use moral-vice language more than left-leaning and that far-right individuals’ grievance language (violence, hate, paranoia, etc.) significantly differs from the moderates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="signals-of-ideology" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Signals of Ideology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In online social settings, researchers face numerous barriers that prevent using traditional methods.
Directly asking users for their ideologies has dubious success, infringes on platform T&amp;amp;Cs, and does not scale to online populations.
Inferring users’ ideologies from their activity also does not scale as the data requires is prohibitively expensive and tedious to compile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, to reduce expert labor to feasible levels, researchers infer ideologies from signals in user behavior – such as whether they use political hashtags, retweet politicians, or follow political parties.
We dub these signals &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, these &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> for online users can still require laborious labeling by context-specific experts.
For example, the hashtag &lt;em>#ScottyFromMarketing&lt;/em> requires an up-to-date expert in Australian politics to uncover that it expresses an anti-right-wing ideology.
For many researchers:
- access to contextual experts is difficult,
- labeling of signals is still laborious and expensive,
- and context switches require relabelling (exasperating the above problems).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, such context switches are commonplace, as the context changes with time, country, or social platform.
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:teaser">1&lt;/a> showcases the problem: most commonly used &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> can only be transferred in narrow circumstances (represented by the green dotted regions).
For example, following political parties is country-dependent, politicians come and go with time, and hashtags are platform-dependent.
As such, we desire an &lt;em>ideological proxy&lt;/em> that is robust to changes in context, requires no expert labeling and is true to the gold standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:teaser">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="teaser_v2.svg" alt="Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 1: Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Not all ideological proxies can context-switch](teaser.png) -->
&lt;p>Furthermore, the &lt;em>ideological proxies&lt;/em> are often sparse among users; however, we would ideally like to detect influence amongst the entire population of users (as taking only active users could bias our inferences).
We further desire a method for inferring the ideology of (potentially inactive) users without direct &lt;em>ideological proxy&lt;/em> information.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="our-solution-you-are-what-you-browse" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Our Solution: You are what you browse&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our solution is a large-scale end-to-end ideology detection pipeline that can be used to profile entire populations of users.
The solution has two main components; the media proxy and the inference architecture.
The media proxy allows for labeling a subset of users, and the inference architecture allows for propagating these labels to the remaining users via socially-informed homophilic lenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="the-media-proxy" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>The Media Proxy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the first part of our work, we generate a proxy based on media-sharing behavior, which satisfies the desiderata.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We generate the media proxy via two media slant datasets (although many are widely available).
The first is an extensive survey of media consumption behaviors conducted by Reuters &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-newman2019reuters" role="doc-biblioref">Newman et al. 2019&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> in several countries in 2020 and 2021.
Participants reported the media publications they consume and their own political ideology.
We estimate the slant of a media source for each country and year as the average ideology of the participants who consume it.
The second dataset is the Allsides Media Bias Dataset &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-sides2018media" role="doc-biblioref">Sides 2018&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which contains an expert-curated set of media publications.
The Allsides dataset contains mostly American-based media; conversely, Reuters covers the major media outlets in each country.
Given that each country and period will have a different conception of ideologies, we calibrate Reuter’s media slants to approximate the Allsides (minimizing the mean-squared error). Figure &lt;a href="#fig:slants">2&lt;/a> shows the slants for each media website within the Reuters dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:slants">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="url_slants.svg" alt="Plot showing the slants for various media websites." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 2: Plot showing the slants for various media websites.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![The slants for various media websites](./url_slants.png) -->
&lt;!-- We finally define the media slant of a media website, as its average over the country, year, and sources, and -->
&lt;p>Finally, we quantify a user’s ideology as the average ideology of their shared media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The media proxy resolves the issue of context switching; since it is applicable across many contexts and can be used widely in a fully automated fashion.
This allows us to create an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We further define methods to classify far-right users from their media-sharing behaviors, which we fully describe in the paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-inference-architecture" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>The Inference Architecture&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the second part of our work, we define an inference architecture that allows inferring the ideological labels of the remaining users – e.g., users who do not share any URLs.
Our inference architecture relies on the sociological principle of homophily, where we hypothesize that similar users will share a similar ideology.
We measure homophily through three distinct lenses;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lexical&lt;/em>: Users with similar language will have similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Hashtag&lt;/em>: Users who participate in similar topics of discussion share a similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Resharing&lt;/em>: Users who consume similar content (signaled via resharing of other users) will share a similar ideology&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Through these lenses, we utilize an AutoML model, FLAML &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-wang2021flaml" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> (with the LightGBM architecture), trained on users identified via an ideological proxy to propagate the labels to the remaining users and generate a complete ideological profile for a dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-data" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>The Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We utilize several large-scale datasets from various platforms to showcase the relative ease of applying our end-to-end pipeline.

&lt;div id="psychosocial-profiles-of-the-ideological-groups" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>Psychosocial profiles of the Ideological Groups&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Large-scale profiling of entire online populations gives us significant insights into the characteristics of online populations.
We apply our inferred ideological labels of online users in two critical ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>We derive a method for distinguishing the left and the right in terms of their moral language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We derive a method for distinguishing moderate and extreme ideologies in terms of their grievance language.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distinguishing Left and Right&lt;/strong>:
We utilize the FrameAxis &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-mokhberian2020moral" role="doc-biblioref">Mokhberian et al. 2020&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> methodology to metricize each user’s association with each of the five Moral Foundations &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-graham2013moral" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al. 2013&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> in terms of their vice and virtue axes.
Given the measures of the Moral Foundations in the user language, we can start to detect in what way the left and the right differ.
To do this, we find each ideological group’s mean vice and virtue scores and compare these to the neutral group.
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:mft">3&lt;/a> shows the outcome of this analysis on the SocialSense dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:mft">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="mft_diff_plot.svg" alt="Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 3: Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Plot showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language](mft_diff_plot.png) -->
&lt;p>We see that the left prefers the language of virtue, while the right prefers the language of vice.
This trend is largely consistent across all datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distinguishing Moderates and Extremes&lt;/strong>: We similarly generate measures via the Grievance Dictionary &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-van2021grievance" role="doc-biblioref">Van der Vegt et al. 2021&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, a threat assessment tool designed to highlight potential threats through their language.
Similar to the previous plot, we investigate the distribution of grievance scores for the ideological groups.
However, here we measure the difference between distributions with the Signed KL-divergence (a measure of the difference in the location and shape of distributions).
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:grievance">4&lt;/a> shows the results for the Ausvotes dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span style="display:block;" id="fig:grievance">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="grievance_diff_plot.svg" alt="Plot of the grievance categories of ideological groups in the #Ausvotes dataset, showing that the far-right is significantly different." width="700px" />
&lt;p class="caption">

&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- ![Plot showing that the far-right use grievance language](grievance_diff_plot.png) -->
&lt;p>We observe that the far-right’s usage of grievance language is significantly different from the moderate ideological groups.
This adds evidence to the growing concern that members of the far-right may vent their frustration and participate in violent behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this work, we build a fully automatic end-to-end ideology detection pipeline for left-right and far-right detection.
Importantly, with the pipeline, we can show the differences between the left and right, and moderates and extremes in terms of psychosocial language, across a range of diverse datasets.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="problematic-speech-a-modern-plague">Problematic Speech: A Modern Plague&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Problematic speech is online interactions, speech, and artifacts that are inaccurate, misleading, inappropriately attributed, or altogether fabricated [1].
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic alerted the world to complex issues that arise from social media platforms circulating user-generated misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories [2].
There are several primary types of quantitative methods for addressing problematic information, including large-scale monitoring of social media datasets [3], understanding platforms, users, and networks contributing to the &amp;ldquo;infodemic&amp;rdquo; [4], and predicting future pathways of information spreading [5].
These studies provide valuable insights into understanding how problematic information spreads and detecting which sources are reshared frequently and by which accounts.
However, these approaches often have less to say about why certain opinions and views gain traction with vulnerable groups and online communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qualitative research methods are well placed to address this gap.
They provide rich, contextual insights into online communities&amp;rsquo; social beliefs, values, and practices, which shape how information is shared and how opinions are formed [6].
Nevertheless, a common criticism of qualitative research is that the in-depth knowledge comes at the expense of generating insights of limited representativeness and weak robustness of the findings.
Therefore, there is a gap between the depth of insight gained from ethnographic and qualitative approaches and the breadth of knowledge gained from computational methods from data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our work fills this gap by proposing a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative insights, large-scale data collection, and human-in-the-loop machine learning approaches.
We apply our method to map in-depth and in-breadth the problematic information around four topics:
&lt;em>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>Climate change&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>COVID-19&lt;/em>, and
&lt;em>Vaccination&lt;/em>
on three social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-mixing-digital-ethnography-with-advanced-machine-learning">Our Solution: Mixing Digital Ethnography with Advanced Machine Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig1.png" alt="The pipeline of machine learning accelerated qualitative research where the human-in-the-loop machine learning algorithms are employed for dataset augmentation.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present a complete solution that bridges and facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis to study problematic online speech.
The pipeline consists of three components which are detailed in this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deep-qualitative-study">Deep qualitative study&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first component is the qualitative study.
We build a platform based on an open-source tool, &lt;a href="https://wikiba.se/">&lt;em>Wikibase&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, where we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Through the quantitative study, we build an ontology of problematic online speech.
We label a large number of social media postings using their topics.
Simultaneously, we construct a vocabulary of 71 opinions that we also use to label postings.
Some example opinions include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis isn't real&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change is a UN hoax&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vaccines cause Autism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Health Organisation is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These opinions contain mistrust in the government and supra-national structures (e.g., UN, WHO) and typical misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="unlabeled-data-collection">Unlabeled data collection&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Qualitative approaches analyze emerging content and construct the vocabulary simultaneously when labeling the data.
However, they lack representativeness as they tend to be overly concentrated on narrow areas of the narrative landscape.
For this reason, the second step in our methodology involves collecting data at scale.
We collect large-scale raw data using the uncovered vocabulary from the deep qualitative study.
We construct keywords (shown in the table) for each topic to crawl social media data from three platforms.
We obtain a total of &lt;strong>13,321,813&lt;/strong> postings — &lt;strong>11,437,009&lt;/strong> Facebook postings, &lt;strong>1,793,927&lt;/strong> tweets and &lt;strong>90,877&lt;/strong> YouTube comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="keywords">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dataset-augmentation">Dataset augmentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The next step is to annotate all the postings in our dataset automatically.
We employ machine learning algorithms to augment the data labeling process with a human-in-the-loop setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By adopting the state-of-the-art text classification algorithm, RoBERTa [7,8], we first train the classifiers to identify problematic speech on postings annotated by the qualitative researchers.
Next, we deploy three strategies to select unlabeled data.
The active learning [9] strategy selects the data for which the classifiers are most uncertain.
The top-confidence strategy selects data that classifiers are most certain about.
The third strategy — the random strategy — randomly samples from unlabeled data.
The qualitative researchers then label the sampled data, introduce the newly labeled data in the ontology, and repeat the procedure iteratively until the predictive performance converges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="humanintheloop-performance">Human-in-the-loop Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We discuss here the convergence of prediction performance over labeling iterations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot depicts the prediction performance on the test set macro-averaged over topics (accuracy in the left panel and F1 score on the right panel) over iterations.
The solid lines show the performance indicators, together with the cross-validation generalization error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cross-validation performance is stable across iterations.
This is expected as the classifiers learn from the same data on which the generalization is estimated — i.e., the classifiers are representative of the data they were trained on.
However, the difference between the test set performance and cross-validation performance is indicative of the representativity over the entire dataset.
The cross-validation accuracy is consistently lower than the test set accuracy because the test data is more imbalanced than labeled data.
The cross-validation F1 is more optimistic than the test set F1.
Finally, the difference between the two stabilizes for the later iterations, further suggesting the convergence.
&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Convergence of topic classifier performances over seven iterations.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="applying-the-qualitative-mapping">Applying the Qualitative Mapping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We employ the obtained augmented labeled set to analyze the dynamics of problematic opinions at scale.
We machine-label the opinions in a large set of postings spanning over a long time, allowing us to apply the qualitative-defined coding schema to a significantly larger sample of postings.
This reduces the unavoidable selection bias of the deep qualitative study.
It also offers a critical tool for analyzing co-occurring opinions, which helps identify central opinions.
It is common for postings to express multiple opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We explore central opinions by building an opinion co-occurrence network in the online conversation of the topic &lt;strong>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/strong>.
In the network, nodes are the opinions captured during the bushfire conversation, while edges are present when both opinions are detected in the same postings.
The node degree of a given opinion node represents the number of opinions that co-occurred with it.
The edges are weighted by the number of postings in which their connected node opinions co-occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot presents each edge's daily proportions of weights among all edges between September 2019 and January 2020.
We show six edges (i.e., opinion pairs) to represent three types of temporal dynamics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A continuous and relatively strong association between prevalent opinions — &amp;ldquo;Climate change crisis isn't real&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax,&amp;rdquo; which not notably is a conspiracy theory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Associations with declining relative frequencies — &amp;ldquo;Greta Thunberg should not have a platform or influence as a climate&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women and girls don't deserve a voice in the public sphere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rising associations such as &amp;ldquo;bushfires and climate change not related&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo;; and also the conspiracy theory associations between &amp;ldquo;United Nations is corrupt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Daily proportions of edge weights of six selected co-occurred opinions pairs.">&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the following plot, we map the co-occurrence network from posts published over 14 days in late September 2019, i.e., the period when the betweenness for conspiracy opinions is at peak.
This figure explains the ambivalent network role that conspiracy opinions can play: we first note a conspiracy opinion with relatively high degree and frequency — &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax&amp;rdquo; —, while we also observe the presence of low degree but high betweenness conspiracy opinions at the periphery of the network — &amp;ldquo;Bushfires linked to secret elites&amp;rsquo; secret technology (chemtrails, HAARP, HSRN, geoengineering)&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;bushfires deliberately lit to promote a climate change agenda&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Australia should not be a member of the United Nations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

Last year, the number of websites registered on the &amp;ldquo;.com&amp;rdquo; domain &lt;a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/zone-file/index.xhtml">surpassed 150,000,000&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, more than a quarter of a century since its first commercial use, the growth of the online world is now slowing down in some key categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conducted a multi-year research project analysing global trends in online diversity and dominance. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249993">Our research&lt;/a>, published in Public Library of Science, is the first to reveal some long-term trends in how businesses compete in the age of the web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We saw a dramatic consolidation of attention towards a shrinking (but increasingly dominant) group of online organisations. So, while there is still growth in the functions, features and applications offered on the web, the number of entities providing these functions is shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-diversity-nosedives">Web diversity nosedives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We analysed more than six billion user comments from the social media website Reddit dating back to 2006, as well as 11.8 billion Twitter posts from as far back as 2011. In total, our research used a massive 5.6Tb trove of data from more than a decade of global activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This dataset was more than four times the size of the original data from the Hubble Space Telescope, which helped Brian Schmidt and colleagues do their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-win-tells-us-the-universe-is-accelerating-what-does-that-mean-3753">Nobel-prize winning work&lt;/a> in 1998 to prove &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300499/meta">the universe's expansion is accelerating&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Reddit posts, we analysed all the links to other sites and online services — more than one billion in total — to understand the dynamics of link growth, dominance and diversity through the decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We used a measure of link &amp;ldquo;uniqueness&amp;rdquo;. On this scale, 1 represents maximum diversity (all links have their own domain) and 0 is minimum diversity (all links are on one domain, such as &amp;ldquo;youtube.com&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decade ago, there was a much greater variety of domains within links posted by users of Reddit, with more than 20 different domains for every 100 random links users posted. Now there are only about five different domains for every 100 links posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="featured.png" alt="Our Reddit analysis showed the pool of top-performing sources online is shrinking.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, between 60-70% of all attention on key social media platforms is focused towards just ten popular domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond social media platforms, we also studied linkage patterns across the web, looking at almost 20 billion links over three years. These results reinforced the &amp;ldquo;rich are getting richer&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authority, influence and visibility of the top 1,000 global websites (as measured by network centrality or PageRank) is growing every month, at the expense of all other sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="app-diversity-is-on-the-rise">App diversity is on the rise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The web started as a source of innovation, new ideas and inspiration — a technology that opened up the playing field. It's now also becoming a medium that actually stifles competition and promotes monopolies and the dominance of a few players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings resolve a long-running paradox about the nature of the web: does it help grow businesses, jobs and investment? Or does it make it harder to get ahead by letting anyone and everyone join the game? The answer, it turns out, is it does both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the diversity of sources is in decline, there is a countervailing force of continually increasing functionality with new services, products and applications — such as music streaming services (Spotify), file sharing programs (Dropbox) and messaging platforms (Messenger, Whatsapp and Snapchat).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="website-infant-mortality">Website ‘infant mortality&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another major finding was the dramatic increase in the &amp;ldquo;infant mortality&amp;rdquo; rate of websites — with the big kids on the block guarding their turf more staunchly than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We examined new domains that were continually referenced or linked-to in social media after their first appearance. We found that while almost 40% of the domains created 2006 were active five years on, only a little more than 3% of those created in 2015 remain active today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dynamics of online competition are becoming clearer and clearer. And the loss of diversity is concerning. Unlike the natural world, there are no sanctuaries; competition is part of both nature and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our study has profound implications for business leaders, investors and governments everywhere. It shows the network effects of the web don't just apply to online businesses. They have permeated the entire economy and are rewriting many previously accepted rules of economics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the idea that businesses can maintain a competitive advantage based on where they are physically located is increasingly tenuous. Meanwhile, there's new opportunities for companies to set up shop from anywhere in the world and serve a global customer base that's both mainstream and niche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way to encourage diversity is to have more global online businesses focused on providing diverse services, by addressing consumers&amp;rsquo; increasingly niche needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Australia, we're starting to see this through homegrown companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://safetyculture.com/">SafetyCulture&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://iwonder.com/">iWonder&lt;/a>. Hopefully many more will appear in the decade ahead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most statistics students will be familiar with the phrase “correlation isn’t causation,” however, this doesn’t feature strongly in the remainder of their educations. To overcome this hurdle, the researchers’ best practice in experimental design is the randomized controlled trial. However, there are only specific experiments that we can perform. For example, to test the whether smoking causes cancer, we can’t force subjects to smoke. &lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">In the 1950s the tobacco companies argued that there could be some confounding factor (a gene) which smokers and lung cancer patients shared.&lt;/span> In general, restricting ourselves to experimental studies to determine causation is incredibly limiting (especially for data scientists). We want to make the same causal conclusions from observational studies and those from experimental studies. We can do that by studying causal inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="simpsons" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Simpson’s Paradox&lt;/h2>
An example of the importance of understanding causal relationships is given by Simpson’s Paradox &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-simpson1951interpretation" role="doc-biblioref">Simpson 1951&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which describes a peculiar phenomenon that can present in data sets, where a correlation between two variables is present in one direction but reverses in each stratum of the data. The paradox expressed best through an example:
&lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">This appears to suggest that the more someone exercises, the higher their cholesterol is! This is absurd!&lt;/span>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span id="fig:simpsons-before">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="./index_files/figure-html/simpsons-before-1.png" alt="The results of an experiment, where x-axis represents how much exercise an individual does in hours, and y-axis represents cholestral measurment for the same individual." width="672" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 1: The results of an experiment, where x-axis represents how much exercise an individual does in hours, and y-axis represents cholestral measurment for the same individual.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:simpsons-before">1&lt;/a> shows a positive correlation in an experiment that measures individuals’ exercise per week and cholesterol. At first glance, this seems absurd, but when we partition the data by another causal variable, this seems reasonable:
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span id="fig:simpsons-after">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/simpsons-after-1.png" alt="The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age" width="672" />
&lt;p class="caption">

&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">(Also note, we have fabricated the data, although these relationships are quite plausible)&lt;/span>
Understanding the full causal story is essential. Without an entire causal narrative, we might recommend inappropriate interventions; for example, a doctor might prescribe less exercise to reduce cholesterol in the case above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To deduce such causal stories, we need to apply the methodology of causal inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="structural-equation-models-and-causal-graphs" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Structural Equation Models and Causal Graphs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A structural equation model (SEM) is a set of equations representing the relationship between variables. For example, the equations which generated the data from &lt;a href="#simpsons">the Simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>, are given as:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
age &amp;amp;= U_1 \\
exercise &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{13}*age + U_2 \\
cholesteral &amp;amp;= -4*exercise + age + U_3
\end{align*}
\]&lt;/span>
We can think of &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_1\)&lt;/span>, &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_2\)&lt;/span>, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_3\)&lt;/span> as specific unobserved exogenous variables of an individual, which generate their endogenous variables (something like error terms).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A causal graph is a DAG which describes the existence of relationships between variables in a model. An edge &lt;code>x -&amp;gt; y&lt;/code> represents the relationship &lt;code>x&lt;/code> directly causes &lt;code>y&lt;/code>. Consequently, causal graphs can represent SEMs:
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed this graph shows how age confounds the effect of exercise on cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="do-calculus" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Do-calculus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl1995causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl1995causal" role="doc-biblioref">1995&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> outline a method to remove this confounding (and other similar scenarios) using do-calculus. Outlining the specifics of do-calculus is beyond the scope of this blog post (but for interested readers, we suggest &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>). In brief, do-calculus introduces the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator, which acts as an intervention and fixes a variable to a particular constant. For example, consider a similar binary situation to &lt;a href="#simpsons">the Simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>, where &lt;em>exer&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual is active, &lt;em>chol&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual has high cholesterol, and &lt;em>age&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual is over 60.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>bin_simpsons_data &amp;lt;- simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
mutate(age = age &amp;gt; 60) %&amp;gt;% # Binarize the age, so those over 60 are True, and under 60 are False
mutate(exer = exercise&amp;gt;mean(exercise)) %&amp;gt;% # Binarize the exercise level, so those above the average are True, and under are False
mutate(chol = cholesteral&amp;gt;mean(cholesteral)) # Binarize the cholesteral level, so those above the average are True, and under are False&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We ask the same experimental question; does exercise reduce cholesterol. A naive approach would be to compute the effect as &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer = 1) - P(chol | exer = 0)=\)&lt;/span> 0.168, where &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer)\)&lt;/span> is computed by filtering the data according to &lt;em>exer&lt;/em>. Taking this approach, we would erroneously observe that the effect was positive since those who exercise more are also old and more likely to have high cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The experimental best practice approach would be to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A random selection of individuals are assigned to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> a high exercise regiment and the others &lt;em>do&lt;/em> a low exercise regiment (regardless of age). The RCT implicitly removes the natural tendency of exercise to vary with age and allows researchers to observe the causal effect of exercise on cholesterol. When using data generated in such a fashion, increases/decreases in the probability of having high cholesterol caused by exercise are given by &lt;span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 1) - P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 0)\)&lt;/span>. This metric is known as the Average Causal Effect (ACE), sometimes called the Average Treatment Effect. Note that by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(exer=x\)&lt;/span>, with data generated by an RCT, researchers are essentially limiting the data used to estimate &lt;span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)&lt;/span>, to individuals who were &lt;strong>forced&lt;/strong> to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> an exercise regiment &lt;span class="math inline">\(x\)&lt;/span>. The &lt;em>do&lt;/em> here represents forcing individuals to take an intervention value, regardless of their natural tendency, and this is captured by the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator. In this case, &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = x)) = P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)&lt;/span>, since the data was generated with an RCT. However, RCTs can be prohibitively expensive (both in time and money) and might not be necessary to tease out a causal effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would still like to estimate the ACE, &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = 1)) - P(chol | do(exer = 0))\)&lt;/span>, by using data that wasn’t generated from an RCT. By using the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator here, we aim to disassociate &lt;em>exer&lt;/em> from its natural tendency with &lt;em>age&lt;/em> and effectively perform a graph surgery:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> provide an adjustment formula for just this scenario:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z \frac{P(X=x, Y=y, PA=z)}{P(X=x| PA=z)}
\]&lt;/span>
where &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> represents the variable we are acting on, &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> the variable we measure results from, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(PA\)&lt;/span> the parents of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> or more generally any nodes that satisfy the back-door criterion (which we will introduce later). Note this allows us to derive the causal effect, as if we had generated data with an RCT, using only probabilities estimated from data not generated by an RCT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such we compute our ACE for the binary scenario:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code># The Joint Distribution P(age, exer, chol) i.e. P(x,y,z)
p_aec &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age, exer, chol) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Marginal Distribution P(age) i.e. P(z)
p_a &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Marginal Distribution P(age, exer) i.e. P(x, z)
p_ea &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age, exer) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Conditional Mariginal Distribution P(exer | age) i.e. P(x | z)
p_e_a &amp;lt;- p_a %&amp;gt;%
right_join(p_ea, by=&amp;quot;age&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = freq.y/freq.x) %&amp;gt;%
select(age, exer, freq)
# The Intervention Distribution P(chol | do(exer)) i.e. P(y | do(x))
probabilities &amp;lt;- data.table(p_aec %&amp;gt;%
left_join(p_e_a, by=c(&amp;quot;age&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;exer&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = freq.x/freq.y) %&amp;gt;%
select(age, exer, chol, freq) %&amp;gt;%
filter(chol) # We are only concerned with what cause high cholestral
)
# The average causal effect of exer on chol
ACE &amp;lt;- sum(probabilities[exer==T, freq]) - sum(probabilities[exer==F, freq]) &lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This procedure leads to a negative ACE of -0.175, which shows the causal effect of going from high to low exercise on the probability of getting high cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A natural question that follows from this example is, under what conditions can we use such adjustments to achieve an identifiable causal effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="d-seperation" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>d-seperation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To understand common scenarios where the effect of variable &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable within a causal graph, we must first introduce the concept of d-separation, also known as blocking. A pair of variable &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> are said to be blocked if they are conditionally independent, given a set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>. There are three graph types, which are essential for blocking:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the chain scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={M}\)&lt;/span>. This is sometimes refered to as the mediation scenario, which we will address further in &lt;a href="#front-door">the front-door criterion&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the fork scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={Z}\)&lt;/span>. This is sometimes refered to as the confounder scenario, which is the situation in &lt;a href="#simpsons">the simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, in the collider scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by &lt;em>not&lt;/em> conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={M}\)&lt;/span>. The idea that &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, which are independent, to begin with, can become conditionally dependant is unintuitive. One way to think about this is that we are sharing information received from $ Y $ with $ X $ through $ M $ when we condition on $ M $. For a more thorough investigation into this phenomenon, refer to &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A path is said to be blocked by &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> if it contains a chain or fork with its middle node in &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> or a collider with its middle node not in &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now ready to introduce the main criteria for which we can perform adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-backdoor" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>The Backdoor&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="definition">
&lt;span id="def:unnamed-chunk-10" class="definition">&lt;strong>Definition 1 (The Backdoor Criterion) &lt;/strong>&lt;/span>A set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>, given a DAG &lt;span class="math inline">\(G\)&lt;/span> and a pair of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\((X,Y)\)&lt;/span>, is said to satisfy the backdoor criterion if no node in &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> is a descendant of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span>, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> blocks all paths between &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, which contain arrows into &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span>.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If there exists are set of nodes why satisfy the backdoor criterion, then the effect of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable and given by:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z \frac{P(X=x, Y=y, Z=z)}{P(X=x| Z=z)}
\]&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The backdoor criterion stops undue influence through the &lt;em>backdoor&lt;/em> paths; it leaves direct paths between &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, and it blocks spurious paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is clear that { &lt;em>age&lt;/em> } satisfies these conditions to be a backdoor adjustment set in the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="front-door" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>The Front-door&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are notably common scenarios where this doesn’t work. For example, consider a constructed causal mediation situation, as follows:
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case we cannot use the backdoor criterion, to detect the effect of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> on &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em> because &lt;em>tar&lt;/em> is a descendant of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em>, and there exists no direct link between &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> and &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em>. We must use instead the frontdoor criterion:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="definition">
&lt;span id="def:unnamed-chunk-13" class="definition">&lt;strong>Definition 2 (The Frontdoor Criterion) &lt;/strong>&lt;/span>A set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>, given a DAG &lt;span class="math inline">\(G\)&lt;/span> and a pair of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\((X,Y)\)&lt;/span>, is said to satisfy the frontdoor criterion if; &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> intercepts all direct paths from &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> to &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, all paths between &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> are blocked, and all backdoor paths between &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> are blocked by &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span>.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If there exists are set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> which satisfy the frontdoor criterion, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(x, z)&amp;gt;0\)&lt;/span>, then the effect of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable and given by:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z P(z|x) \sum_{x^\prime} P(y|x^\prime, z)P(x^\prime)
\]&lt;/span>
In our smoking scenario, we see that by adjusting for &lt;em>tar&lt;/em> , we can observe the effect of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> on &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The above briefly outlines a core motivation for studying causal inference and causal stories. We summarise some of the underlying theory of causal inference and show practical methodology through the &lt;em>frontdoor&lt;/em> and &lt;em>backdoor&lt;/em> criterion for determining causal effects through entirely observational studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are notable aspects of causal inference we have omitted from this taster. The most gaping is the lack of an explanation for the powerful tool of counterfactuals. We have only presented binary examples here (aside from our motivating example); however, perhaps the most common and useful causal inference application is to continuous examples using regression with linear models. Ultimately, we decided this was beyond causal inference taster’s scope and were more deserving of their own articles. Again, for the interested reader, we recommend &lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which adds links to many other resources.&lt;/p>
