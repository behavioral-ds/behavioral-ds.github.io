&lt;p>Say you are looking for a new job. You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476">new study&lt;/a> of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don't know well enough to share a personal connection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strength-of-weak-ties">The strength of weak ties&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1973, the American sociologist &lt;a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mark-granovetter">Mark Granovetter&lt;/a> coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086%2F225469">the strength of weak ties&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weak-ties-and-jobs">Weak ties and jobs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Granovetter's theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform's &amp;ldquo;People You May Know&amp;rdquo; recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this &amp;ldquo;A/B testing&amp;rdquo; to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many &amp;ldquo;job transmissions&amp;rdquo; occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moderately-weak-ties-are-best">Moderately weak ties are best&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What's a &amp;ldquo;moderately&amp;rdquo; weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-recommendations">Better recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter's theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-black-boxes">The power of black boxes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28051930">Facebook's infamous emotion experiment of 2014&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, could LinkedIn's experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the &amp;ldquo;strong link&amp;rdquo; treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doing research online (by SAGE Research Methods): A Mixed-Method to Explain How Extreme Opinions Infiltrate Online Discussions</title><link>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme2_content/sage-research-methods-online-problematic-content/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme2_content/sage-research-methods-online-problematic-content/</guid><description>&lt;iframe scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen="true" width="640" height="360" src="https://methods.sagepub.com/video/embed/srmpromo/21fyoz/mapping-online-problematic-content-mixing-approaches">Your browser does not support iFrames.&lt;/iframe>

&lt;h3 id="problematic-speech-a-modern-plague">Problematic Speech: A Modern Plague&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Problematic speech is online interactions, speech, and artifacts that are inaccurate, misleading, inappropriately attributed, or altogether fabricated [1].
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic alerted the world to complex issues that arise from social media platforms circulating user-generated misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories [2].
There are several primary types of quantitative methods for addressing problematic information, including large-scale monitoring of social media datasets [3], understanding platforms, users, and networks contributing to the &amp;ldquo;infodemic&amp;rdquo; [4], and predicting future pathways of information spreading [5].
These studies provide valuable insights into understanding how problematic information spreads and detecting which sources are reshared frequently and by which accounts.
However, these approaches often have less to say about why certain opinions and views gain traction with vulnerable groups and online communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qualitative research methods are well placed to address this gap.
They provide rich, contextual insights into online communities&amp;rsquo; social beliefs, values, and practices, which shape how information is shared and how opinions are formed [6].
Nevertheless, a common criticism of qualitative research is that the in-depth knowledge comes at the expense of generating insights of limited representativeness and weak robustness of the findings.
Therefore, there is a gap between the depth of insight gained from ethnographic and qualitative approaches and the breadth of knowledge gained from computational methods from data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our work fills this gap by proposing a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative insights, large-scale data collection, and human-in-the-loop machine learning approaches.
We apply our method to map in-depth and in-breadth the problematic information around four topics:
&lt;em>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>Climate change&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>COVID-19&lt;/em>, and
&lt;em>Vaccination&lt;/em>
on three social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-solution-mixing-digital-ethnography-with-advanced-machine-learning">Our Solution: Mixing Digital Ethnography with Advanced Machine Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig1.png" alt="The pipeline of machine learning accelerated qualitative research where the human-in-the-loop machine learning algorithms are employed for dataset augmentation.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present a complete solution that bridges and facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis to study problematic online speech.
The pipeline consists of three components which are detailed in this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deep-qualitative-study">Deep qualitative study&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first component is the qualitative study.
We build a platform based on an open-source tool, &lt;a href="https://wikiba.se/">&lt;em>Wikibase&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, where we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Through the quantitative study, we build an ontology of problematic online speech.
We label a large number of social media postings using their topics.
Simultaneously, we construct a vocabulary of 71 opinions that we also use to label postings.
Some example opinions include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Climate change crisis isn't real&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climate change is a UN hoax&lt;/li>
&lt;li>United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vaccines cause Autism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Health Organisation is corrupt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These opinions contain mistrust in the government and supra-national structures (e.g., UN, WHO) and typical misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="unlabeled-data-collection">Unlabeled data collection&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Qualitative approaches analyze emerging content and construct the vocabulary simultaneously when labeling the data.
However, they lack representativeness as they tend to be overly concentrated on narrow areas of the narrative landscape.
For this reason, the second step in our methodology involves collecting data at scale.
We collect large-scale raw data using the uncovered vocabulary from the deep qualitative study.
We construct keywords (shown in the table) for each topic to crawl social media data from three platforms.
We obtain a total of &lt;strong>13,321,813&lt;/strong> postings — &lt;strong>11,437,009&lt;/strong> Facebook postings, &lt;strong>1,793,927&lt;/strong> tweets and &lt;strong>90,877&lt;/strong> YouTube comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="keywords">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dataset-augmentation">Dataset augmentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The next step is to annotate all the postings in our dataset automatically.
We employ machine learning algorithms to augment the data labeling process with a human-in-the-loop setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By adopting the state-of-the-art text classification algorithm, RoBERTa [7,8], we first train the classifiers to identify problematic speech on postings annotated by the qualitative researchers.
Next, we deploy three strategies to select unlabeled data.
The active learning [9] strategy selects the data for which the classifiers are most uncertain.
The top-confidence strategy selects data that classifiers are most certain about.
The third strategy — the random strategy — randomly samples from unlabeled data.
The qualitative researchers then label the sampled data, introduce the newly labeled data in the ontology, and repeat the procedure iteratively until the predictive performance converges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="humanintheloop-performance">Human-in-the-loop Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We discuss here the convergence of prediction performance over labeling iterations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot depicts the prediction performance on the test set macro-averaged over topics (accuracy in the left panel and F1 score on the right panel) over iterations.
The solid lines show the performance indicators, together with the cross-validation generalization error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cross-validation performance is stable across iterations.
This is expected as the classifiers learn from the same data on which the generalization is estimated — i.e., the classifiers are representative of the data they were trained on.
However, the difference between the test set performance and cross-validation performance is indicative of the representativity over the entire dataset.
The cross-validation accuracy is consistently lower than the test set accuracy because the test data is more imbalanced than labeled data.
The cross-validation F1 is more optimistic than the test set F1.
Finally, the difference between the two stabilizes for the later iterations, further suggesting the convergence.
&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Convergence of topic classifier performances over seven iterations.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="applying-the-qualitative-mapping">Applying the Qualitative Mapping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We employ the obtained augmented labeled set to analyze the dynamics of problematic opinions at scale.
We machine-label the opinions in a large set of postings spanning over a long time, allowing us to apply the qualitative-defined coding schema to a significantly larger sample of postings.
This reduces the unavoidable selection bias of the deep qualitative study.
It also offers a critical tool for analyzing co-occurring opinions, which helps identify central opinions.
It is common for postings to express multiple opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We explore central opinions by building an opinion co-occurrence network in the online conversation of the topic &lt;strong>2019-20 Australian bushfire season&lt;/strong>.
In the network, nodes are the opinions captured during the bushfire conversation, while edges are present when both opinions are detected in the same postings.
The node degree of a given opinion node represents the number of opinions that co-occurred with it.
The edges are weighted by the number of postings in which their connected node opinions co-occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following plot presents each edge's daily proportions of weights among all edges between September 2019 and January 2020.
We show six edges (i.e., opinion pairs) to represent three types of temporal dynamics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A continuous and relatively strong association between prevalent opinions — &amp;ldquo;Climate change crisis isn't real&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax,&amp;rdquo; which not notably is a conspiracy theory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Associations with declining relative frequencies — &amp;ldquo;Greta Thunberg should not have a platform or influence as a climate&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women and girls don't deserve a voice in the public sphere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rising associations such as &amp;ldquo;bushfires and climate change not related&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bushfires were caused by random arsonists&amp;rdquo;; and also the conspiracy theory associations between &amp;ldquo;United Nations is corrupt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;United Nations wants to be the global ruling government&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Daily proportions of edge weights of six selected co-occurred opinions pairs.">&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the following plot, we map the co-occurrence network from posts published over 14 days in late September 2019, i.e., the period when the betweenness for conspiracy opinions is at peak.
This figure explains the ambivalent network role that conspiracy opinions can play: we first note a conspiracy opinion with relatively high degree and frequency — &amp;ldquo;Climate change is a UN hoax&amp;rdquo; —, while we also observe the presence of low degree but high betweenness conspiracy opinions at the periphery of the network — &amp;ldquo;Bushfires linked to secret elites&amp;rsquo; secret technology (chemtrails, HAARP, HSRN, geoengineering)&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;bushfires deliberately lit to promote a climate change agenda&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Australia should not be a member of the United Nations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="featured.png" alt="A visualization of the co-occurrence network in late September 2020 — node sizes and colors indicate the degrees and betweenness values">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>‘Fake news’ and broader ‘information disorders’ [6] such as mis- and disinformation have emerged as global issues that threaten to undermine democracy and authentic political communication on social media [1]. Increasingly sophisticated coordination strategies have intensified the scale and scope of the impact that disinformation has on public opinion and democratic trust. Howard et al. [3] found that coordinated disinformation operations are now occurring in 48 countries, and in 2019 the European External Action Service detected and exposed over 1,000 cases of disinformation within the European Union [2]. Whilst disinformation has attracted much scholarly attention, most studies to date have focussed on the diffusion and impact of individual content (e.g. ‘fake news’ articles) and the activity of individual accounts (e.g. bots and trolls).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An emerging problem is to understand message coordination strategies, where content authored and distributed by agents (e.g. Twitter trolls) is governed and scheduled by some unknown principal actor [4]. We know that coordinated promotion (e.g. sharing, liking, retweeting) of ‘fake news’ articles by trolls and social bots can greatly increase and amplify the negative effects of these attempts to sow discord and manipulate public conversations about election candidates and partisan issues such as immigration and climate change. Likewise, it is evident that disinformation campaigns unfold via ‘collaborative work’ that co-opts and cultivates organic systems in order to produce desired effects such as increased polarisation, distrust in news media and confusion of the audience [7]. This makes identifying ‘inauthentic’ versus ‘organic’ activity ever more difficult, as they are intricately enmeshed in real-world disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring the coordinated promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ articles using a novel approach known as Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP; see [5]). We analyse the diffusion of articles from ten major sources of hyperpartisan information and ‘fake news’ within over 16.5 million tweets that linked to content from these sites during July to September 2019. Using HIP, we uncover not only coordination strategies but also the promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ content, where agents (in this case Twitter accounts) are being centrally managed by principals (e.g. state operatives, government officials, etc.) in order to strategically promote ‘fake news’ content and maximise its virality and longevity in the social memory. This paper provides preliminary results from this ongoing research, highlighting the current challenges as well as open problems and gaps for future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-panel-coordinated-inauthentic-behaviour-in-social-media-new-methods-and-findings">The panel: &amp;ldquo;Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour in Social Media: New Methods and Findings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="panel-rationale">Panel Rationale&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Social media platforms are increasingly forced to address what Facebook now describes as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (Gleicher 2018): online influence operations that seek to trick platform algorithms into promoting and recommending ‘problematic information’ (Jack 2017), to mislead the human users of such platforms into accepting and sharing such content, and thereby also to affect broader issue frames and news agendas in mainstream media coverage. Concerns about such coordinated inauthentic behaviour extend earlier fears about the influence of malignant social bots, but also transcend them: drawing on social bots as well as human labour, coordinated inauthentic behaviour is likely to involve a combination of manual and automated activity. This additional human factor also complicates the detection of such coordinated activities, and their distinction from genuine, organic, authentic coordinated actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cross-national and interdisciplinary panel approaches the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour from a number of directions. It outlines novel and innovative detection and analysis approaches for a number of leading social media platforms, and presents their results in the context of domestic and international political debates across several national contexts. Further, it also considers how mainstream journalism might report on and respond to such activities in order to protect news audiences from being affected by coordinated inauthentic behaviours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two papers in this panel focus especially on coordinated inauthentic link-sharing practices. Paper 1 introduces Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP), a novel technique for inferring the coordinated content promotion schedules of automated social media accounts, and applies this to a major dataset of 16.5 million tweets containing links to ten major sites identified as sources of hyperpartisan content and ‘fake news’. In doing so, it uncovers new networks of inauthentic Twitter actors. Paper 2 investigates similar coordinated link-sharing activity on Facebook in Italy during the 2018 Italian and 2019 European elections. It uncovers evidence for the involvement of dozens of pages, groups, and public profiles in such media manipulation attempts. Paper 3 complements this work by focussing especially on the temporal posting patterns in such coordinated activity. It employs the recurrence plotting technique to identify traces of inauthentic actors’ use of automated scheduling tools in systematically posting content to a network of apparently unrelated pages, focussing here especially on a group of far-right pages on Facebook. Paper 4 examines ten coordinated disinformation campaigns across the globe (e.g., Hong Kong, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany) and identifies important traits that help distinguish between those participating in the disinformation campaign and the regular users they try to imitate. Paper 5, finally, shifts our attention to a core target of such coordinated inauthentic behaviour: the journalists and editors whose perception of current political moods such influence operations often aim to affect. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with Danish news workers and related stakeholders, it examines their understanding of and responses to coordinated mis- and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collectively, these studies contribute substantially to advancing the methodological toolkit and extending the empirical evidence base for the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, while also not losing sight of the stakeholders that such work seeks to support. They offer an independent assessment of the nature and extent of the problem across several leading social media platforms, complementing the platform providers’ own investigations into such activities and identifying possible responses to such concerns for both social and mainstream media actors.&lt;/p>

Last year, the number of websites registered on the &amp;ldquo;.com&amp;rdquo; domain &lt;a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/zone-file/index.xhtml">surpassed 150,000,000&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, more than a quarter of a century since its first commercial use, the growth of the online world is now slowing down in some key categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conducted a multi-year research project analysing global trends in online diversity and dominance. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249993">Our research&lt;/a>, published in Public Library of Science, is the first to reveal some long-term trends in how businesses compete in the age of the web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We saw a dramatic consolidation of attention towards a shrinking (but increasingly dominant) group of online organisations. So, while there is still growth in the functions, features and applications offered on the web, the number of entities providing these functions is shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-diversity-nosedives">Web diversity nosedives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We analysed more than six billion user comments from the social media website Reddit dating back to 2006, as well as 11.8 billion Twitter posts from as far back as 2011. In total, our research used a massive 5.6Tb trove of data from more than a decade of global activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This dataset was more than four times the size of the original data from the Hubble Space Telescope, which helped Brian Schmidt and colleagues do their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-win-tells-us-the-universe-is-accelerating-what-does-that-mean-3753">Nobel-prize winning work&lt;/a> in 1998 to prove &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300499/meta">the universe's expansion is accelerating&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Reddit posts, we analysed all the links to other sites and online services — more than one billion in total — to understand the dynamics of link growth, dominance and diversity through the decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We used a measure of link &amp;ldquo;uniqueness&amp;rdquo;. On this scale, 1 represents maximum diversity (all links have their own domain) and 0 is minimum diversity (all links are on one domain, such as &amp;ldquo;youtube.com&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decade ago, there was a much greater variety of domains within links posted by users of Reddit, with more than 20 different domains for every 100 random links users posted. Now there are only about five different domains for every 100 links posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="featured.png" alt="Our Reddit analysis showed the pool of top-performing sources online is shrinking.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, between 60-70% of all attention on key social media platforms is focused towards just ten popular domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond social media platforms, we also studied linkage patterns across the web, looking at almost 20 billion links over three years. These results reinforced the &amp;ldquo;rich are getting richer&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authority, influence and visibility of the top 1,000 global websites (as measured by network centrality or PageRank) is growing every month, at the expense of all other sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="app-diversity-is-on-the-rise">App diversity is on the rise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The web started as a source of innovation, new ideas and inspiration — a technology that opened up the playing field. It's now also becoming a medium that actually stifles competition and promotes monopolies and the dominance of a few players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings resolve a long-running paradox about the nature of the web: does it help grow businesses, jobs and investment? Or does it make it harder to get ahead by letting anyone and everyone join the game? The answer, it turns out, is it does both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the diversity of sources is in decline, there is a countervailing force of continually increasing functionality with new services, products and applications — such as music streaming services (Spotify), file sharing programs (Dropbox) and messaging platforms (Messenger, Whatsapp and Snapchat).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="website-infant-mortality">Website ‘infant mortality&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another major finding was the dramatic increase in the &amp;ldquo;infant mortality&amp;rdquo; rate of websites — with the big kids on the block guarding their turf more staunchly than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We examined new domains that were continually referenced or linked-to in social media after their first appearance. We found that while almost 40% of the domains created 2006 were active five years on, only a little more than 3% of those created in 2015 remain active today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dynamics of online competition are becoming clearer and clearer. And the loss of diversity is concerning. Unlike the natural world, there are no sanctuaries; competition is part of both nature and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our study has profound implications for business leaders, investors and governments everywhere. It shows the network effects of the web don't just apply to online businesses. They have permeated the entire economy and are rewriting many previously accepted rules of economics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the idea that businesses can maintain a competitive advantage based on where they are physically located is increasingly tenuous. Meanwhile, there's new opportunities for companies to set up shop from anywhere in the world and serve a global customer base that's both mainstream and niche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way to encourage diversity is to have more global online businesses focused on providing diverse services, by addressing consumers&amp;rsquo; increasingly niche needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Australia, we're starting to see this through homegrown companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://safetyculture.com/">SafetyCulture&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://iwonder.com/">iWonder&lt;/a>. Hopefully many more will appear in the decade ahead.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- Motivation -->
&lt;!-- Framing: Problem -> Solution -->
&lt;!-- Context -->
&lt;p>Social media platforms, although relatively new, host millions of users and billions of interactions daily. As tied as we are to these platforms, they profoundly impact our social institutions through phenomena such as disinformation, political polarization, and social bots.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Problem -->
&lt;p>Researchers are increasingly interested in trying to form an understanding of phenomena and their implications. Social scientists, political scientists, and data practitioners alike curate expansive datasets to combat these potentially adverse effects on our society; however, they lack the appropriate tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Solution -->
&lt;p>&lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is an &lt;strong>easy-to-use&lt;/strong> tool that models Twitter users&amp;rsquo; attributes and labels them. It comes prepackaged with a &lt;strong>state-of-the-art bot detector&lt;/strong> and an &lt;strong>influence quantification&lt;/strong> system based on tweet dynamics. &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> features a generalized user labeler, which can be retrained easily with the engineered features to address a variety of use cases. Also, &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml/">birdspotter.ml&lt;/a> is a web application that can be utilized to explore datasets and derive a narrative around a dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I'll showcase the basic usage of &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> and &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml/">birdspotter.ml&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The package can be installed in the canonical python way:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{bash}">pip install birdspotter
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="getting-a-dataset">Getting a dataset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Twitter T&amp;amp;Cs restrict the sharing of tweet data directly online; however, they do allow the sharing of tweet-ids, which can be converted to full tweet data through a process called &lt;em>hydration&lt;/em>. Tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">twarc&lt;/a> can be used to hydrate a Tweet ID dataset. The resulting dataset will be in &lt;code>jsonl&lt;/code> (line delimited &lt;code>json&lt;/code>) format, which &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> accepts directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the below examples, we use two datasets; a collection of COVID-19 related tweets from January 31st, 2020 [1], and a collection of tweets about politicians on Twitter [2].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The politicians&amp;rsquo; dataset was acquired through the following process (and a similar process was taken for the COVID-19 dataset):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{bash}">pip install twarc
wget http://twitterpoliticians.org./downloads/base/all_tweet_ids.csv
twarc hydrate all_tweet_ids.csv &amp;gt; tweets.jsonl
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The code below imports the main class &lt;code>Birdspotter&lt;/code>, extracts the tweets from their standard format, labels the users with the default bot detector and influence, and reformats the retweet cascades into a tidier format.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{python}">## Import birdspotter
from birdspotter import BirdSpotter
## Extracts the tweets from the raw jsonl [https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs]
bs = BirdSpotter('covid19.jsonl')
## Uses the default bot labeller and influence quantification systems
bs.getLabeledUsers()
## Formats the retweet cascades, such that expected retweet structures can extracted
bs.getCascadesDataFrame()
## Access the botness labels and influence scores
bs.featureDataframe[['botness', 'influence']]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From here, the dataset is readily profile-able:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-{python}">botness_dist = sns.histplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=&amp;quot;botness&amp;quot;)
influence_eccdf = sns.ecdfplot(data=bs.featureDataframe, x=&amp;quot;influence&amp;quot;, complementary=True).set(xscale=&amp;quot;log&amp;quot;, yscale=&amp;quot;log&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.behavioral-ds.science/img/covid_profile.png" alt="COVID Dataset Profile: (Left) The distribution of bot scores of users; (Right) The ECCDF of influence scores of users, showing a long-tailed (rich-gets-richer) paradigm">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-visualizer">The visualizer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An alternative way to profile a dataset is the use &lt;a href="http://birdspotter.ml">&lt;code>birdspotter.ml&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, which facilitates dataset exploration and narrative construction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.behavioral-ds.science/img/auspol_teaser.png" alt="birdspotter.ml visualizer: The various components shown include the scatterplot panel (Left), the user information panel (Top Right), and the retweet cascades panel (Bottom Right)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The visualizer features a scatterplot (on the left) of influence and botness for a sample of users and the population density. The colors represent the hashtags (a proxy for the topic) that the users most tweet about in the dataset. Users within the scatterplot are hoverable and selectable, and their information populates in the components on the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The top right component shows information and metrics about the selected user and links the user's profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom right component shows the retweet cascades where a user has participated and highlights their participation. The points represent the follower counts (social capital) of users and their retweets/tweets&amp;rsquo; timing. The points are also hoverable and selectable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customising-the-labeller">Customising the labeller&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default, the labeler is trained as a bot detection system, comparable to the state-of-the-art &lt;a href="https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/">&lt;code>botometer&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. Notable, &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is provided in an offline package and can be applied at scale, while &lt;code>botometer&lt;/code> is accessible only via an online API, which is often prohibitively rate-limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code> is a versatile tool and can be utilized by practitioners for a variety of use-cases. For example, we could train the labeler to identify political leaning. This process is a bit involved, so we summarise it below;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We hydrate some tweets from the Twitter Parlimentarian Database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We filter the tweets to include only &lt;strong>Australian Politicians&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We &lt;strong>label right-wing partied politicians positively&lt;/strong>, and others negatively (with &lt;code>bs_pol.getBotAnnotationTemplate&lt;/code> for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We &lt;strong>retrain &lt;code>birdspotter&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> with these new labels and label all users (i.e., including users the politicians retweeted) using the new model&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We build a machine learning-based &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> that can accurately predict the probability of transitioning between occupations. We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles and real-time job ads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also build a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For full technical details, please read the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our latest research, &lt;a href="authors/nik-dawson/">Nik Dawson&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="authors/ma-rizoiu/">Marian-Andrei Rizoiu&lt;/a> (together with collaborator &lt;a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-mary-anne-williams">Mary-Anne Williams&lt;/a>) and I developed a novel method to measure the &amp;lsquo;distance&amp;rsquo; between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em> using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn't to say that it's not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-skill-space-method">The SKILL SPACE Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between skills&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage&amp;rsquo; (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1A.png" alt="Figure 1A.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python&amp;rsquo; and ‘C++&amp;rsquo;. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development&amp;rsquo; and ‘Healthcare&amp;rsquo;) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge&amp;rsquo; to specialist skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em>. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1B.png" alt="Figure 1B.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244">Frey and Osborne&lt;/a> - dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo;, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo; represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="constructing-a-job-transitions-recommender-system">Constructing a Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that &lt;strong>job transitions are &lt;em>asymmetric&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual&amp;rsquo; (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset - described as the transition probability between a ‘source&amp;rsquo; and a ‘target&amp;rsquo; occupation. This creates the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em>, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig2.png" alt="Figure 2.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source&amp;rsquo; occupations are in columns and ‘targets&amp;rsquo; are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager&amp;rsquo; has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk&amp;rsquo; than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas&amp;rsquo;) than others (‘Life Scientists&amp;rsquo;). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our model achieves high levels of performance, &lt;strong>accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommending-jobs-and-skills">Recommending Jobs and Skills&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations. We call this the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em>. In the figure below, we highlight the example of `Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo;, an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig4.png" alt="Figure 4.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we use the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo; all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential&amp;rsquo; services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo;, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favorable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo; as the target occupation for this example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Skill recommendations for target occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then take the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is important to the target occupation&lt;/strong> &lt;em>and&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance to acquire the skill is large&lt;/strong> (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance&amp;rsquo;. Conversely, the reasons &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to develop a skill are when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is not important&lt;/strong> &lt;em>or&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance is small to the target occupation&lt;/strong>. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs require ‘Business Analysis&amp;rsquo; and ‘Finance&amp;rsquo; skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing&amp;rsquo; and ‘Laundry&amp;rsquo; are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developing-a-leading-indicator-of-ai-adoption">Developing a Leading Indicator of AI Adoption&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE method can also be flexibly applied to other adjacent problems, such as identifying the extent of specific skill gaps of firms within industries and potential adoption of new technologies. Here, we develop a leading indicator for emerging technology adoption and potential labour market disruptions based on skills data, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example. We select AI because of its potential impacts on transforming labour tasks and accelerating job transitions. By applying SKILL SPACE, we were able to measure the yearly similarities between an adaptive set of AI skills against each of the 19 Australian industries from 2013-2019 (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for technical details). As industry skill sets become more similar to AI skills, the skills gap is diminished and firms within industries are more likely to possess the skills to make productive use of AI technologies. The growth of AI skill similarity within industries is shown by the coloured areas of the radar chart below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig5.png" alt="Figure 5.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All industries have increased their similarity levels to AI skills. This highlights the growing importance of AI skills across the Australian labour market. However, the rates of similarity are unequally distributed. Some industries, such as ‘Finance and Insurance Services&amp;rsquo; and ‘Information Media and Telecommunications&amp;rsquo; command much higher rates of AI skill similarity. This indicates that not only are firms within these industries increasingly demanding AI skills but also that the AI skills gaps within these industries are much smaller. Therefore, it is likely that firms within these industries are adopting AI and making productive use of these technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also noteworthy are the differences in growth rates toward AI skill similarity. As the figure above clearly shows, AI skill similarity has rapidly grown for some industries and more modestly for others. For instance, ‘Retail Trade&amp;rsquo; has experienced the highest levels of growth in similarity to AI skills, increasing by 407% from 2013 to 2019. The majority of this growth has occurred recently, which coincides with the launch of Amazon Australia in 2017. Since then, Amazon has swiftly hired thousands in Australia. This indicator can assist policy-makers and businesses to robustly monitor the growth of AI skills (or other emerging technologies), which acts as a proxy for AI adoption within industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises, and other factors will continue to shift labour demands causing workers to move between jobs. If labour transitions occur efficiently, significant productivity and equity benefits arise at all levels of the labour market; if transitions are slow, or fail, significant costs are borne to both the State and the individual. Therefore, it's in the interests of workers, firms, and governments that labour transitions are efficient and effective. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="dataset">Dataset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this tutorial, we apply two tools for analyzing Twitter users, on a COVID-19 retweet dataset. The dataset
is curated by Chen, et al. One can obtain a copy of the tweet IDs from
their &lt;a href="https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs">project&lt;/a>. We
only use the 31st of Janury sample of the whole dataset for
demonstration purpose. The tweets can be recovered by &lt;code>hydration&lt;/code>
from their IDs. We note that some tweets might have been deleted and in
the end we manage to get 69.2% (1,489,877) of the original tweets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While &lt;code>BirdSpotter&lt;/code> captures the social influence and botness of Twitter
users, &lt;code>evently&lt;/code> specifically models the temporal dynamics of online
information diffusion. We leverage information provided by the tools to
study the users in the COVID19 dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">library(evently)
library(reticulate)
birdspotter &amp;lt;- import('birdspotter')
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="preprocessing-tweets">Preprocessing tweets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this step, we seek to extract diffusion cascades from the &lt;code>COVID-19&lt;/code>
dataset for analyzing user influence and botness. A diffusion cascade
consist of an initial tweet posted by a Twitter user and followed then
by a sereis of retweets. A function provided by &lt;code>evently&lt;/code> allows one to
obtain cascades from JSON formatted raw tweets. On the other hand, we
initialize a &lt;code>BirdSpotter&lt;/code> instance and compute the influence and
botness scores for all users in the
dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">cascades &amp;lt;- parse_raw_tweets_to_cascades('corona_2020_01_31.jsonl', keep_user = T, keep_absolute_time = T)
bs &amp;lt;- birdspotter$BirdSpotter('corona_2020_01_31.jsonl')
labeled_users &amp;lt;- bs$getLabeledUsers()[, c('user_id', 'botness', 'influence')]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As we cannot publish &lt;code>corona_2020_01_31.jsonl&lt;/code> due to Twitter TOC, we
have stored the results and load them below&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">load('corona_2020_01_31.rda')
labeled_users &amp;lt;- read.csv('corona_31_botness_influence.csv', stringsAsFactors = F,
colClasses=c(&amp;quot;character&amp;quot;,rep(&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;,3)))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We note that all user IDs have been encrypted. After obtaining the
results, let’s first conduct some simple measurements on users and

&lt;p>Most statistics students will be familiar with the phrase “correlation isn’t causation,” however, this doesn’t feature strongly in the remainder of their educations. To overcome this hurdle, the researchers’ best practice in experimental design is the randomized controlled trial. However, there are only specific experiments that we can perform. For example, to test the whether smoking causes cancer, we can’t force subjects to smoke. &lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">In the 1950s the tobacco companies argued that there could be some confounding factor (a gene) which smokers and lung cancer patients shared.&lt;/span> In general, restricting ourselves to experimental studies to determine causation is incredibly limiting (especially for data scientists). We want to make the same causal conclusions from observational studies and those from experimental studies. We can do that by studying causal inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="simpsons" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Simpson’s Paradox&lt;/h2>
An example of the importance of understanding causal relationships is given by Simpson’s Paradox &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-simpson1951interpretation" role="doc-biblioref">Simpson 1951&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which describes a peculiar phenomenon that can present in data sets, where a correlation between two variables is present in one direction but reverses in each stratum of the data. The paradox expressed best through an example:
&lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">This appears to suggest that the more someone exercises, the higher their cholesterol is! This is absurd!&lt;/span>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span id="fig:simpsons-before">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="./index_files/figure-html/simpsons-before-1.png" alt="The results of an experiment, where x-axis represents how much exercise an individual does in hours, and y-axis represents cholestral measurment for the same individual." width="672" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 1: The results of an experiment, where x-axis represents how much exercise an individual does in hours, and y-axis represents cholestral measurment for the same individual.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
Figure &lt;a href="#fig:simpsons-before">1&lt;/a> shows a positive correlation in an experiment that measures individuals’ exercise per week and cholesterol. At first glance, this seems absurd, but when we partition the data by another causal variable, this seems reasonable:
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span id="fig:simpsons-after">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/simpsons-after-1.png" alt="The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age" width="672" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 2: The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>&lt;input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">&lt;span class="marginnote">(Also note, we have fabricated the data, although these relationships are quite plausible)&lt;/span>
Understanding the full causal story is essential. Without an entire causal narrative, we might recommend inappropriate interventions; for example, a doctor might prescribe less exercise to reduce cholesterol in the case above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To deduce such causal stories, we need to apply the methodology of causal inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="structural-equation-models-and-causal-graphs" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Structural Equation Models and Causal Graphs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A structural equation model (SEM) is a set of equations representing the relationship between variables. For example, the equations which generated the data from &lt;a href="#simpsons">the Simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>, are given as:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
age &amp;amp;= U_1 \\
exercise &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{13}*age + U_2 \\
cholesteral &amp;amp;= -4*exercise + age + U_3
\end{align*}
\]&lt;/span>
We can think of &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_1\)&lt;/span>, &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_2\)&lt;/span>, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(U_3\)&lt;/span> as specific unobserved exogenous variables of an individual, which generate their endogenous variables (something like error terms).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A causal graph is a DAG which describes the existence of relationships between variables in a model. An edge &lt;code>x -&amp;gt; y&lt;/code> represents the relationship &lt;code>x&lt;/code> directly causes &lt;code>y&lt;/code>. Consequently, causal graphs can represent SEMs:
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed this graph shows how age confounds the effect of exercise on cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="do-calculus" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Do-calculus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl1995causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl1995causal" role="doc-biblioref">1995&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> outline a method to remove this confounding (and other similar scenarios) using do-calculus. Outlining the specifics of do-calculus is beyond the scope of this blog post (but for interested readers, we suggest &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>). In brief, do-calculus introduces the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator, which acts as an intervention and fixes a variable to a particular constant. For example, consider a similar binary situation to &lt;a href="#simpsons">the Simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>, where &lt;em>exer&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual is active, &lt;em>chol&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual has high cholesterol, and &lt;em>age&lt;/em> is a binary variable true if the individual is over 60.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>bin_simpsons_data &amp;lt;- simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
mutate(age = age &amp;gt; 60) %&amp;gt;% # Binarize the age, so those over 60 are True, and under 60 are False
mutate(exer = exercise&amp;gt;mean(exercise)) %&amp;gt;% # Binarize the exercise level, so those above the average are True, and under are False
mutate(chol = cholesteral&amp;gt;mean(cholesteral)) # Binarize the cholesteral level, so those above the average are True, and under are False&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We ask the same experimental question; does exercise reduce cholesterol. A naive approach would be to compute the effect as &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer = 1) - P(chol | exer = 0)=\)&lt;/span> 0.168, where &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer)\)&lt;/span> is computed by filtering the data according to &lt;em>exer&lt;/em>. Taking this approach, we would erroneously observe that the effect was positive since those who exercise more are also old and more likely to have high cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The experimental best practice approach would be to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A random selection of individuals are assigned to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> a high exercise regiment and the others &lt;em>do&lt;/em> a low exercise regiment (regardless of age). The RCT implicitly removes the natural tendency of exercise to vary with age and allows researchers to observe the causal effect of exercise on cholesterol. When using data generated in such a fashion, increases/decreases in the probability of having high cholesterol caused by exercise are given by &lt;span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 1) - P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 0)\)&lt;/span>. This metric is known as the Average Causal Effect (ACE), sometimes called the Average Treatment Effect. Note that by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(exer=x\)&lt;/span>, with data generated by an RCT, researchers are essentially limiting the data used to estimate &lt;span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)&lt;/span>, to individuals who were &lt;strong>forced&lt;/strong> to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> an exercise regiment &lt;span class="math inline">\(x\)&lt;/span>. The &lt;em>do&lt;/em> here represents forcing individuals to take an intervention value, regardless of their natural tendency, and this is captured by the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator. In this case, &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = x)) = P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)&lt;/span>, since the data was generated with an RCT. However, RCTs can be prohibitively expensive (both in time and money) and might not be necessary to tease out a causal effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would still like to estimate the ACE, &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = 1)) - P(chol | do(exer = 0))\)&lt;/span>, by using data that wasn’t generated from an RCT. By using the &lt;span class="math inline">\(do()\)&lt;/span> operator here, we aim to disassociate &lt;em>exer&lt;/em> from its natural tendency with &lt;em>age&lt;/em> and effectively perform a graph surgery:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span> provide an adjustment formula for just this scenario:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z \frac{P(X=x, Y=y, PA=z)}{P(X=x| PA=z)}
\]&lt;/span>
where &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> represents the variable we are acting on, &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> the variable we measure results from, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(PA\)&lt;/span> the parents of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> or more generally any nodes that satisfy the back-door criterion (which we will introduce later). Note this allows us to derive the causal effect, as if we had generated data with an RCT, using only probabilities estimated from data not generated by an RCT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such we compute our ACE for the binary scenario:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code># The Joint Distribution P(age, exer, chol) i.e. P(x,y,z)
p_aec &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age, exer, chol) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Marginal Distribution P(age) i.e. P(z)
p_a &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Marginal Distribution P(age, exer) i.e. P(x, z)
p_ea &amp;lt;- bin_simpsons_data %&amp;gt;%
count(age, exer) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# The Conditional Mariginal Distribution P(exer | age) i.e. P(x | z)
p_e_a &amp;lt;- p_a %&amp;gt;%
right_join(p_ea, by=&amp;quot;age&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = freq.y/freq.x) %&amp;gt;%
select(age, exer, freq)
# The Intervention Distribution P(chol | do(exer)) i.e. P(y | do(x))
probabilities &amp;lt;- data.table(p_aec %&amp;gt;%
left_join(p_e_a, by=c(&amp;quot;age&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;exer&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
mutate(freq = freq.x/freq.y) %&amp;gt;%
select(age, exer, chol, freq) %&amp;gt;%
filter(chol) # We are only concerned with what cause high cholestral
)
# The average causal effect of exer on chol
ACE &amp;lt;- sum(probabilities[exer==T, freq]) - sum(probabilities[exer==F, freq]) &lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This procedure leads to a negative ACE of -0.175, which shows the causal effect of going from high to low exercise on the probability of getting high cholesterol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A natural question that follows from this example is, under what conditions can we use such adjustments to achieve an identifiable causal effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="d-seperation" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>d-seperation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To understand common scenarios where the effect of variable &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable within a causal graph, we must first introduce the concept of d-separation, also known as blocking. A pair of variable &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> are said to be blocked if they are conditionally independent, given a set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>. There are three graph types, which are essential for blocking:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the chain scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={M}\)&lt;/span>. This is sometimes refered to as the mediation scenario, which we will address further in &lt;a href="#front-door">the front-door criterion&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the fork scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={Z}\)&lt;/span>. This is sometimes refered to as the confounder scenario, which is the situation in &lt;a href="#simpsons">the simpson’s paradox example&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, in the collider scenario, &lt;span class="math inline">\(X \sim Y\)&lt;/span> is blocked by &lt;em>not&lt;/em> conditioning on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z={M}\)&lt;/span>. The idea that &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, which are independent, to begin with, can become conditionally dependant is unintuitive. One way to think about this is that we are sharing information received from $ Y $ with $ X $ through $ M $ when we condition on $ M $. For a more thorough investigation into this phenomenon, refer to &lt;span class="citation">(&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A path is said to be blocked by &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> if it contains a chain or fork with its middle node in &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> or a collider with its middle node not in &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now ready to introduce the main criteria for which we can perform adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="the-backdoor" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>The Backdoor&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="definition">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If there exists are set of nodes why satisfy the backdoor criterion, then the effect of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable and given by:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z \frac{P(X=x, Y=y, Z=z)}{P(X=x| Z=z)}
\]&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The backdoor criterion stops undue influence through the &lt;em>backdoor&lt;/em> paths; it leaves direct paths between &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> and &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span>, and it blocks spurious paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is clear that { &lt;em>age&lt;/em> } satisfies these conditions to be a backdoor adjustment set in the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="front-door" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>The Front-door&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are notably common scenarios where this doesn’t work. For example, consider a constructed causal mediation situation, as follows:
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case we cannot use the backdoor criterion, to detect the effect of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> on &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em> because &lt;em>tar&lt;/em> is a descendant of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em>, and there exists no direct link between &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> and &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em>.

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If there exists are set of nodes &lt;span class="math inline">\(Z\)&lt;/span> which satisfy the frontdoor criterion, and &lt;span class="math inline">\(P(x, z)&amp;gt;0\)&lt;/span>, then the effect of &lt;span class="math inline">\(X\)&lt;/span> on &lt;span class="math inline">\(Y\)&lt;/span> is identifiable and given by:
&lt;span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z P(z|x) \sum_{x^\prime} P(y|x^\prime, z)P(x^\prime)
\]&lt;/span>
In our smoking scenario, we see that by adjusting for &lt;em>tar&lt;/em> , we can observe the effect of &lt;em>smoking&lt;/em> on &lt;em>cancer&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The above briefly outlines a core motivation for studying causal inference and causal stories. We summarise some of the underlying theory of causal inference and show practical methodology through the &lt;em>frontdoor&lt;/em> and &lt;em>backdoor&lt;/em> criterion for determining causal effects through entirely observational studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are notable aspects of causal inference we have omitted from this taster. The most gaping is the lack of an explanation for the powerful tool of counterfactuals. We have only presented binary examples here (aside from our motivating example); however, perhaps the most common and useful causal inference application is to continuous examples using regression with linear models. Ultimately, we decided this was beyond causal inference taster’s scope and were more deserving of their own articles. Again, for the interested reader, we recommend &lt;span class="citation">&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="#ref-pearl2016causal" role="doc-biblioref">2016&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>, which adds links to many other resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A simulated process is represented by a &lt;code>data.frame&lt;/code> where each row is
an event. &lt;code>time&lt;/code> indicates the event happening time, while &lt;code>magnitude&lt;/code>
is the event mark information which is always 1 if &lt;code>model_type&lt;/code> is an
unmarked model. In the context of retweet diffusion cascades, the first
row is the original tweet and all following events are its retweets.
&lt;code>time&lt;/code> records the relative time (in second) of each retweet to the
original tweet and &lt;code>magnitude&lt;/code> is the follows’ count of the user who
retweeted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We can then fit on the cascades simulated in the previous section. After
providing the &lt;code>data&lt;/code> and &lt;code>model_type&lt;/code>, the fitting procedure will spawn
10 AMPL optimization procedures with different parameter
inistializations due to the non-convexity of some likelihood functions.
Among the 10 fitted model, the one giving the best likelihood value will
be returned. To make the fitting procedure faster, we can specify the
number of &lt;code>cores&lt;/code> to be used for fitting them in
parallel.&lt;/p>
